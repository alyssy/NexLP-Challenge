Hi ladies.  Even though mother's day has past, I thought you would enjoy
reading this e-mail I received last week.  It's real good.

A Mother's Thoughts:

We are sitting at lunch when my daughter casually mentions that she and her
husband are thinking of "starting a family." "We're taking a survey," she
says, half-joking. "Do you think I should have a baby?"

"It will change your life, "I say, carefully keeping my tone neutral.

"I know," she says, "no more sleeping in on weekends, no more
spontaneous vacations...."

But that is not what I meant at all.  I look at my daughter, trying to
decide what to tell her.  I want her to know what she will never learn in
childbirth classes.  I want to tell her that the physical wounds of child
bearing will heal, but that becoming a mother will leave her with an
emotional wound so raw that she will forever be vulnerable.  I consider
warning her that she will never again read a newspaper without asking "What
if that had been MY child?" That every plane crash,every house fire will
haunt her.  That when she sees pictures of starving children, she will wonder
if anything could be worse than watching your child die.  I look at her
carefully manicured nails and stylish suit and think that no matter
how sophisticated she is, becoming a mother will reduce her to the
primitive level of a bear protecting her cub.  That an urgent call of "Mom!"
will cause her to drop a souffl, or her best crystal without a moment's
hesitation.  I feel I should warn her that no matter how many years she has
invested in her career, she will be professionally derailed by motherhood.
She might arrange for childcare, but one day she will be going into an
important
business meeting and she will think of her baby's sweet smell.  She will have
to use every ounce of her discipline to keep from running home, just to make
sure her baby is all right.  I want my daughter to know that everyday
decisions will no longer be
routine.  That a five year old boy's desire to go to the men's room
rather than the women's at McDonald's will become a major dilemma. That right
there, in the midst of clattering trays and screaming children, issues of
independence and gender identity will be weighed against the prospect that a
child molester may be lurking in that restroom.  However decisive she may be
at the office, she will second-guess herself constantly as a mother.
Looking at my attractive daughter, I want to assure her that eventually she
will shed the pounds of pregnancy, but she will never feel the same about
herself.  That her life, now so important, will be of less value to her once
she has a child.  That she would give it up in a moment to save her
offspring, but will also begin to hope for more years-not to accomplish her
own dreams, but to watch her child accomplish theirs.  I want her to know
that a cesarean scar or shiny stretch marks will become badges of honor.  My
daughter's relationship with her husband will change,
but not in the way she thinks.  I wish she could understand how much more you
can love a man who is careful to powder the baby or who never hesitates to
play with his child.  I think she should know that she will fall in love with
him again for reasons she would now find every unromantic.  I wish my
daughter could sense the bond she will feel with women throughout history who
have tried to stop war, prejudice and drunk driving.  I hope she will
understand why I can think rationally about most issues, but become
temporarily insane when I discuss the threat of nuclear war to my
children's future.  I want to describe to my daughter the exhilaration of
seeing your child learn to ride a bike.  I want to capture for her the belly
laugh of a baby who is touching the soft fur of a dog or a cat for the first
time.  I want  her to  taste the joy that is so real, it actually hurts.  My
daughter's quizzical look makes me realize that tears have formed in my eyes.

"You'll never regret it," I finally say. Then I reach across the table,
squeeze my daughter's hand and offer a silent prayer for her,and
for me, and for all of the mere mortal women who stumble their way into this
most wonderful of callings.  This blessed gift from God that of being a
Mother.

Please share this with a Mom that you know or a future Mom you know.

Please review.


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=
ferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=
arding the Phantom Stock Account.

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=
tribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=
nalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =
of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=
s of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=
ceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=
of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=
of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=
rators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=
s a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=
ock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=
res in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=
n several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=
at the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=
f Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=
section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=
"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=
ctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=
t apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=
ution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=
ment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =
is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=
he Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=
ue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=
g price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=
ment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=
This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=
share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =
beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=
p. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=
ction 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=
distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1

Number of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=
es
Relative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13
Phantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658
10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866
Value to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792
Current stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10
Distribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =
administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=
.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =
a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =


In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=
same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=

USA: Enron says recent woes to hurt profitability.

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. , which agreed last week to a buyout by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. , said on Wednesday it expects its recent woes to have a "temporary but negative impact" on fourth-quarter profitability.
Enron executives said in a conference call with analysts and investors that fourth-quarter results would also be adversely affected by severance costs and other restructuring costs. It did not provide further details, but said it expects to issue fourth-quarter earnings guidance in two to three weeks.
Enron also said it is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity to help rebuild confidence in the company and keep its core trading operations afloat in the nine months before the acquisition by Dynegy is expected to close.
Enron, the nation's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, agreed on Friday to be bought by Dynegy for about $9 billion in stock after investor unease over the company's business deals sapped its finances to the point of near-collapse.
Enron has been under the gun from Wall Street since mid-October when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $1.2 billion because of off-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who was later replaced. The deals are under investigation by U.S. regulators.

USA: Enron traders seen riding out storm, cuts likely.
By Scott DiSavino

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Traders at Enron Corp., atop the energy trading world, are avidly being pursued by rivals but are holding out to see if there is a good deal awaiting them in the proposed buyout by Dynegy Inc.
While a number of jobs are expected to go after the near collapse of North America's biggest energy trader, the new owners are expected to pull out all the stops to keep Enron's top traders - seen as the company's key assets.
"I know (traders) are getting a ton of calls, but I don't think there is going to be a mass exodus from the trading floor," said Joe Baker, president of Houston-based Search Consultants International, a recruitment company that serves the energy and power marketing industry.
Enron, known for turning out some of the industry's most aggressive traders, also has a reputation as a tough training ground for newcomers, handsomely rewarding those who "make their numbers" and quickly showing non-performers the door.
Traders at other energy firms said experienced traders can earn six-figures salaries before annual bonuses, paid sometime between the beginning of January and the middle of March.
A company recruiting traders before the bonus is paid would have to pay a larger sign on bonus.
"The majority of the key traders are going to wait and see what kind of situation develops ... everyone's got their eyes open," Baker said. "Most people want to stick around to see what kind of bonus they are going to get."
WAIT AND SEE
Energy traders are clearly worried about the $9 billion takeover announced last week, an opportunity for Dynegy to chop head count.
"There's a lot of overlap at both firms. I don't think there will be enough room for everyone," a trader at another Texas-based energy firm said.
Enron is the nation's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. Dynegy is about a fifth as big as Enron measured in terms of revenue.
Despite the job uncertainty hanging over their heads, traders said they could not name a single Enron or Dynegy trader actively scouting out a new employer.
"Everyone seems to be waiting to see what happens. There are only a few trader jobs open in the country right now. Those positions will likely be filled pretty quickly if this merger goes through," another trader said.
"Some (traders) are going to be looking for work no matter whether they're laid off or leave on their own," the trader added.
So far, it is mostly Enron support staff who are polishing off their resumes.
Enron said Wednesday in an analyst meeting the company expects to take a charge for severance in the fourth quarter. However, no job cut numbers were discussed.
Baker said the support staff feels their jobs are the ones most threatened by the proposed Dynegy merger.
Dynegy is buying Enron for its trading operation and has said it is confident the best will stick around.
Upon completion of the merger, the combined company, to be called Dynegy Inc., is expected to have revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90 billion in assets.
Dynegy agreed to buy its larger cross-town rival after Enron investors lost faith in the company whose stock plummeted following its disclosure of off-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by its former chief financial officer.
The stock was off 8 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $9.92 a share at the close on New York Stock Exchange trade Wednesday, well below its 52-week high of $84.88.
Meanwhile, Dynegy stock fell $1.58, or 0.7 percent, to $46.20 a share.

USA: Arbs tread lightly on Enron-Dynegy deal.
By Dane Hamilton

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Merger arbitragers say they're treading lightly in betting over prospects for the $9 billion stock-swap takeover of Houston energy trader Enron Corp. by rival Dynegy Inc. .
These market pros, who bet on the likelihood a merger will be completed, say big questions about Enron's financial condition raise doubts about the deal and make them shy about risking heavy bets. Wednesday's conference call between Enron officials and investors did little to assuage that, they say.
"People are very nervous about Enron," said one arb at a major New York brokerage. "They aren't sure if Enron is actually earning anything."
Arbs who think a deal will eventually be completed may "short" the acquirer and buy target stock, reasoning that the acquirer's stock will fall and the target will rise on completion. But in recent days, Enron's stock has languished, while Dynegy's stock has gained more than 40 percent, although it was close to the same level a month ago.
Some arbs said Dynegy's stock may have risen because it could gain valuable pipeline assets whether or not a deal is completed. Enron said it granted Dynegy an option to buy its Northern Natural Gas pipeline system for less than $975 million if the deal falls apart after the months-long due diligence review.
"Now Dynegy has up to a year to look at the company and at worst, Dynegy comes away with a very good deal," said one arb. "Even if it's a disaster, they come away with a very valuable pipeline."
Once a Wall Street high-flyer boasting a $90 share price just 15 months ago, Enron fell from grace after off-balance sheet transactions and financial reporting lapses prompted a regulatory investigation and senior official resignations.
Looming debt and a collapsing share price led Enron to agree to a takeover by smaller Houston rival Dynegy last week then valued at $10.41 a share, a fraction of its former value.
Enron officials on Wednesday said they were confident that the company was close to gaining a clear picture of its financial condition following restatement of earnings over several years. But it said the Securities and Exchange Commission investigation "could affect us on a go-forward basis."
Even with commitments for billions of dollars in cash that Enron said it's obtained in recent days, some arbs worried that customers who buy and sell energy contracts through Enron may be abandoning the company, particularly for longer-term contracts.
While Enron officials said customers and others are getting "comfortable in the short-dated market" energy market, arbs said longer-term customers may worry that further damaging disclosures may threaten its financial viability.
"It may be that no one wants long-term agreements anymore with Enron," said one arb, who like others, asked not to be named. "I don't think they were completely open about that issue."

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron CEO Lay admits to errors with mea culpa.

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Adds analyst comment and details of Lay compensation paragraphs 5 to 7)
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay on Wednesday acknowledged misjudgments and errors that pushed the nation's biggest energy trader to the brink of collapse and forced it to accept a humbling buyout by smaller rival Dynegy Inc.
In a stunning mea culpa to analysts and investors, Lay admitted that Enron had made bad investments, overburdened itself with debt and conducted deals that led to conflicts of interest now under U.S. regulatory investigation.
"We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence. We are fully committed to fixing the problems," he said.
Lay's act of atonement came after Enron said he had decided to waive his right to a $60 million golden parachute as part of Dynegy's planned buyout, following a tense exchange with employees about his severance package on Tuesday.
Lay received a base salary of $1.3 million from Enron for 2000 plus bonuses totaling $10.6 million.
He has also made several million dollars this year by exercising options and selling Enron stock at prices which mostly ranged from $40 to $60, according to Enron filings.
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said Lay's candor could not undo damage already done but was welcome nevertheless. "The fact that he 'fessed up' is a step toward reestablishing credibility in himself and in the company," Barone said.
Enron agreed on Friday to be taken over by Dynegy for about $9 billion in stock, after investor unease over Enron's off-balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $7 last week from a high of $90.56 in August 2000.
"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in non-core businesses," Lay said in a 90-minute conference call.
Many of those investments, such as an ill-fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in India that became mired in a payments dispute, performed below Enron's worst expectations, Lay said.
"The negative impact of these investments have been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet," Lay said.
Deals between Enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, produced "various conflicts of interest, both real and perceived," he added.
Fastow was recently replaced and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Lay, who built Enron into the dominant energy trading company in North America and Europe after it was formed by the merger of two natural gas pipeline companies in 1986, said the core wholesale energy businesses were fundamentally sound.
In the short term, he said, Enron will focus on preventing further deterioration of its credit ratings and maintaining sufficient liquidity to keep the energy businesses running.
Enron's president and chief operating officer, Greg Whalley, said the company expects its recent woes to have a "temporary but negative impact" on profitability.
Whalley told analysts and investors that fourth-quarter results would also be adversely affected by severance costs and other restructuring costs. He did not provide details but said Enron will issue earnings guidance in two to three weeks.
The reference to severance costs was the first allusion to job cuts that are widely viewed as inevitable.
Enron also said it is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity to help rebuild confidence in the company and keep its core trading operations afloat in the nine months before the acquisition by Dynegy is expected to close.
It has already received $1.5 billion in cash from oil company ChevronTexaco Corp. , which owns 26.5 percent of Dynegy.
Enron has been under heavy fire from Wall Street since mid-October when it said shareholder equity had been cut by $1.2 billion because of deals with the Fastow partnerships.
Dynegy has said that its agreement with Enron would allow it to back out of the acquisition if the company's problems, which include a stack of lawsuits from angry investors, turn out to be far worse than has already been disclosed.
However, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson has said he is confident this will not happen.
Watson will head the combined company, which will retain the Dynegy name, and Dynegy will dominate the combined company's senior management and board of directors.
Lay has said he has not yet made up his mind whether to accept Watson's offer of a seat on the board of the new company.
The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the largest U.S. pension fund, said there should be no place for Lay or any other Enron directors on the new Dynegy board.
"The interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities," said Michael Flaherman, chairman of the Calpers Investment Committee.

Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said.
Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.
The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations.
The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger. The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months.
Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares.
The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers. The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits.
During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated. As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business.
Industry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its most valuable business.
In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events.
According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit.
Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said.
For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron's stock price, Rosser said.
In either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional consideration.
Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy.
If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company. ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition.
Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties.
Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade.

USA: Enron queried by EPA on oil pipeline spills.

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The nation's biggest energy trader, Enron Corp. , already reeling from bad investments, too much debt and possible conflicts of interest, said on Wednesday that the government is seeking information on spills from pipelines operated by Enron and its subsidiaries.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Houston-based company said it received a request for information from the Environmental Protection Agency regarding certain spills and discharges since 1998 on oil pipelines operated by Enron and its subsidiaries.
EOTT Energy Partners LLP is the only subsidiary of Enron that has extensive domestic oil pipeline operations, according to the filing.
Enron's response was originally supposed to be filed with the EPA no later than Nov. 7, but it received an extension until Jan. 31.
"EOTT cannot predict the outcome of the EPA inquiry," the company said in the filing.
Enron agreed on Friday to be taken over by Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock after investor unease over off-balance sheet deals drove its stock price down to $7 last week from a high of $90.56 in August 2000.
Many of those investments, such as an ill-fated venture into the water services business and a power plant project in India that became mired in a payments dispute, performed below Enron's worst expectations, Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, said on Wednesday.
In addition, deals between Enron and partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, produced "various conflicts of interest, both real and perceived," he added.
Fastow was recently replaced, and the deals with the partnerships are now under investigation by the SEC.
Enron shares were down 3 cents to $9.96 while Dynegy lost 48 cents to $46.46, both in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron to Sell Off Money-Losing Assets In Bid to Restore Its Financial Health

11/14/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the once-mighty energy trader, is shedding money-losing assets and focusing on its core power-marketing business as it moves toward a merger with rival Dynegy Inc.
The effort is aimed at improving Enron's financial health, following disclosures that the company inflated profit figures and didn't reveal large amounts of debt to shareholders, Enron President and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay told investors Wednesday.
Businesses Enron (ENE) wants to sell include a high-speed Internet unit and power operations in India and Brazil, which Mr. Lay said "have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined when we made these investments."
"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Mr. Lay said during the conference call for investors and analysts.
Last Friday Dynegy (DYN) said it agreed to buy Enron in a deal now worth $10.5 billion, and Mr. Lay said the company is focusing on conserving cash and getting the most out of the core businesses that Enron will keep.
Enron Issues Warning About 4th Quarter Results
Enron executives also said they expect the company's fourth-quarter earnings to be hurt by the ongoing financial problems. They didn't provide details, but said they would issue an outlook for fourth-quarter earnings in two weeks.
In addition, the company said it wouldn't file its quarterly report for the third quarter with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday as it had expected. Jeff McMahon, Enron's newly appointed chief financial officer, said the company expects to make the filing "five days late."
Under regulatory guidelines, publicly traded companies have 45 days from the end of a fiscal quarter to file their financial results with the SEC. Enron reported its third-quarter earnings in mid-October, but has yet to make a filing with the SEC. The filing would include Enron's balance sheet.
In the past, Enron has received criticism for not providing a balance sheet with its quarterly earnings release. Enron officials on the call declined to provide specific details about the company's current cash position. That information is included on the balance sheet.
Dynegy agreed to buy Enron after the energy-trading giant's stock price plunged about 80% in the weeks following Enron's posting of a $618 million third-quarter loss. Dynegy also will assume $13 billion of Enron's debt.
The slide in Enron's share price primarily was a result of large-scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by Enron officers. Those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write-offs and restatements in the past month. They are being investigated by the SEC and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits.
Enron ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who ran some of the partnerships, and restated its earnings back to 1997. But those actions failed to restore investor confidence.
"I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks," Mr. Lay said Wednesday. "This has resulted in a complete loss of investor confidence. We are fully committed to fixing the problems."
Enron executives didn't say how many of the company's 20,000 employees world-wide would lose jobs as businesses are sold, a process they said could take months.
"Our debt balances too high and we need to raise cash," Mr. McMahon said.
Mr. Lay said cash gained from asset sales also would support its core businesses.
Enron is the country's top buyer and seller of natural gas, and the No. 1 wholesale power marketer. The company operates a 25,000-mile gas pipeline system and also markets and trades metals, paper, coal, chemicals, and fiber-optic bandwidth.
Dynegy's purchase of Enron triggered a clause in Mr. Lay's contract giving him $20.2 million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of Enron. But Mr. Lay told Enron employees that he wouldn't accept the money -- a total of up to $60.6 million -- upon completion of the merger. He said nothing about that decision during Wednesday's conference call.
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said the compensation package, in Mr. Lay's contract since 1989, is the only merger-related payment Mr. Lay is eligible for from Enron. A Dynegy spokesman, John Sousa, said the company is unsure whether Mr. Lay can receive a retirement package from them.
Dynegy executives have said that they hope to complete their acquisition of Enron by next summer. The Enron name will vanish when the deal is completed.
Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, will retain those roles for the combined company. Mr. Lay will have no role in day-to-day management. He has been offered a seat on the combined company's board.
Under the merger agreement, Enron retains the right to designate three directors of the combined company. So far, Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley has been designated to be the new company's executive vice president. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Enron has yet to designate two other appointees.
On Tuesday the California Public Employees' Retirement System Board of Administration announced that it would oppose appointment of any Enron board member to the combined company, charging that Enron's board may have failed to adequately monitor its corporate officers. Calpers owns about three million shares of Enron and also owns shares of Dynegy.

Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. Announces that Class Action Suits Against Enron Corporation Have Expanded their Class Periods

11/14/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2001--The following notice is issued by the law firm of Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C., on behalf of its client, who, along with other firms, previously filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE:ENE).
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("The Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The prior complaints charged that during 2000 and 2001 the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's then Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion.
As the result of the Company's November 8, 2001 announcements, however, the class period has been extended to encompass all purchasers of Enron common stock from October 19, 1998 through November 7, 2001. On November 8, 2001, prior to the markets opening, Enron announced it was restating its financial results for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, and the first two quarters of 2001 to correct for errors which had inflated Enron's net income by hundreds of millions of dollars in those years and that audit reports for those years should not be relied upon. Upon these disclosures, Enron's stock dropped to $8.41 per share on November 8, 2001, down from a Class Period high of $90.
Plaintiff's counsel -- Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. -- has significant experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions involving financial fraud. The firm has offices in Washington, D.C., Seattle, Washington and New York, New York and is active in major litigation pending in federal and state courts throughout the nation.
The firm's reputation for excellence has been recognized on repeated occasions by courts which have appointed the firm to lead positions in complex multi-district or consolidated litigation. Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, P.L.L.C. has taken a lead role in numerous important cases on behalf of defrauded investors, and has been responsible for a number of outstanding recoveries which, in the aggregate, total hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
If you purchased shares of Enron stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001 to serve as lead plaintiff for the Class. In order to serve as lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal standards.

Enron Says 4th-Qtr Earnings Cut by Lost Business (Update6)

Enron Says 4th-Qtr Earnings Cut by Lost Business (Update6)

(Updates with closing share prices in 12th paragraph.)

Houston, Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which averted
bankruptcy last week by agreeing to a buyout by Dynegy Inc., said
fourth-quarter earnings will be lowered by severance payments,
reorganization costs and a drop in its energy-trading business.

Enron didn't say how many jobs it plans to cut or what its
expenses will be. Trading volumes declined last week and it's too
soon to tell if the company will recover lost business, Chief
Operating Officer Greg Whalley said during a conference call with
investors.

Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness.

``Business has been affected in the last month,'' Enron Chief
Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said. ``We're going to go back to
basics and focus on our core energy business.''

The company will provide a more detailed fourth-quarter
earnings projection in two to three weeks, Lay said.

Dynegy CEO Charles Watson, who agreed on Friday to acquire
bigger rival Enron in a transaction now valued at more than $24
billion, had said he is confident that Enron's trading business is
sound.

`Greater Acceptance'

Enron has been criticized by investors and has seen its
market value plunge in recent weeks because of concerns it was
using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt. Dynegy
is buying Enron for $9.27 billion in stock and about $15 billion
in assumed debt. Both companies are based in Houston.

Since the buyout was announced, Enron is ``seeing greater
acceptance in the U.S. and Europe to our financial situation in
short-term markets,'' Whalley said. ``It may be a couple of weeks
before we can give comfort to our longer-dated customers.
Hopefully, we'll move up to normal levels in the near future.''

Enron said it will be five days late in filing its third-
quarter earnings statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The filing was supposed to be out by today. The
company also will provide more details about earnings in the
fourth quarter than it has in previous periods, Chief Financial
Officer Jeffrey McMahon said.

Enron spokesman Mark Palmer declined to provide further
details about job cuts. ``Anything we say about layoffs, we're
going to say to our employees first,'' he said.

Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said he didn't know the number of
job cuts or the cost of severance that Enron will have in the
fourth quarter.

Shares of Enron rose 2 cents to $10. Dynegy fell 74 cents to
$46.20. ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy,
declined $3.55 to $86.62.

Providing More Detail

Enron been criticized by investors for not providing enough
information about how it makes its money. The company was expected
to earn 45 cents a share in the fourth quarter, the average
estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.

In the third quarter, Enron had a $618 million loss because
of failed investments in water, telecommunications and retail-
energy sales that cost the company $1.01 billion.

Investors expected Enron's fourth-quarter earnings to be cut
by recent events, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the
$1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000
Dynegy shares.

``They'd have hurt their credibility if they'd said
otherwise,'' Vuchetich said.

$1.5 Billion

Enron said it received $1.5 billion in cash yesterday from
ChevronTexaco as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return,
Dynegy will acquire preferred stock and other rights in an Enron
unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.

If the merger isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to
acquire Northern Natural Gas, Enron said today in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. ChevronTexaco, the second-
largest based U.S. oil company, will provide Dynegy with another
$1 billion after the merger closes.

McMahon also said the company is in talks with several
private investors. The company expects to receive $500 million to
$1 billion from these sources, McMahon said.

``Our debt balance is too high, and we need to raise equity
capital,'' McMahon said. ``In this environment we can't raise
public equity capital very efficiently so we need to go to other
sources.''

The company said it is accelerating attempts to sell ``non-
core assets'' such as its investment in an Indian power plant and
its broadband telecommunications network. Enron has about $8
billion invested in these businesses, and it may take as long as a
year to get rid of the broadband business, Whalley said.

``In hindsight, we made some very bad investments,'' Lay
said. ``These have turned out far worse than we ever imagined.''

Lay, Enron's chairman since February 1986, was entitled to
receive a severance package of more than $60 million after Dynegy
took over Enron. Lay decided yesterday to waive the payment.



Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP Expands Class Period in Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp.

11/14/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2001--The Law Firm of Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP announced today that a class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Texarkana Division on behalf of purchasers of Enron Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE:ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 1999 and November 8, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period"). A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm's website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf.
The complaint charges Enron and certain of its officers and directors with violations of the federal securities laws. On November 8, 2001, Enron announced that it would restate its 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 1Q and 2Q 2001 results because of various income statement and balance sheet adjustments required as the result of Enron's determination that three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated in the financial statements pursuant to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), which caused Enron's 1997 through 2Q 2001 income and assets to be materially overstated. Throughout 1999 and 2000, the price of Enron common stock substantially increased -- rising from $32.50 per share on January 18, 1999 to $83.125 per share on December 29, 2000. The complaint alleges that a substantial basis for this huge gain was the Company's allegedly false and misleading reports of ever increasing revenues and profits.
The effect of the restatement was dramatic. Rather than earning $698 million and $1.01 per share in 1998, Enron's restated earnings fell to $585 million and $0.86 per share. Net income was lowered $186 million in 1999 with EPS dropped from $1.10 to $0.79. Net income was lowered $132 million in 2000 and EPS correspondingly fell from $1.12 to $0.97. The restatement increased Enron's debt by $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $629 million in 2000. Shareholder's equity was reduced by $448 million for 1998, $834 million for 1999, $1.16 billion for 2000, $1.226 billion for first quarter 2001 and $929 million for second quarter 2001. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 1999 and November 8, 2001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 21, 2001. If you are a member of this class, you can join this class action online at http://www.classlawyer.com/sign_up.html. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP or other counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.
Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP has substantial experience representing investors in securities fraud class action lawsuits such as this. The firm has offices in Florida, Arkansas and California, but represents investors throughout the nation. If you have any questions about how you may be able to recover for your losses, or if you would like to consider serving as one of the lead plaintiffs in this lawsuit, you are encouraged to call or e-mail the Firm or visit the Firm's website at www.classlawyer.com.

Fitch: Cinergy's Rating Outlook Negative

11/14/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 14, 2001--Fitch Inc. has changed the Outlook of Cinergy's (CIN) 'BBB+' senior unsecured debt to Negative from Stable due to increased leverage and planned environmental compliance expenditures.
Cinergy is the parent holding company of The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (CGE) and PSI Energy, Inc. (PSI). Fitch rates the senior secured debt of both 'A-.'
The negative outlook reflects the rise in debt leverage due mainly to the acquisition of two natural gas fired generating units from Enron Corp in March 2001. As of Sept. 30, 2001, debt was 63% of total capitalization, up from 59% and 56% at the end of fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. The acquisition consists of Enron's 494- megawatt Brownsville generation facility located in Haywood County, Tennessee and the 504-megawatt Caledonia generation facility located in Lowndes County, Mississippi. To reduce leverage, CIN plans to use proceeds from non-core asset sales to reduce debt and to reinstitute the issuance of new shares to meet obligations under its dividend reinvestment plan and various employee stock plans. If the debt reduction is successful, the outlook could return to stable.
Capital requirements related to CIN's compliance with environmental regulations are also a concern. In September 2000, CIN announced a plan for its subsidiaries to spend about $800 million system wide over the following five years to install pollution control equipment to reduce NOx emissions. A majority of these expenditures will be incurred by PSI, the regulated integrated utility, and should be recovered through rates. The company also reached a tentative agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and other parties to reduce SO2 emissions by shutting down or re-powering with natural gas several coal-fired boilers and installing scrubbers and pollution control systems at several sites. The agreement, if finalized, would require CIN to spend an additional $700 million, mostly during 2008- 2013.
CIN's ratings also take into account the significant earnings and cash flow contribution of its regulated utility businesses, and a revised business strategy for its non- regulated businesses that is less aggressive and more appropriate for this mid-size company. The new strategy emphasizes regional, asset-based energy trading and marketing, customer led origination, and its regulated utility operations. A large amount of CIN's non-regulated revenue will be derived from contractual sales with its subsidiaries, CGE and The Union Light, Heat and Power Company. CGE's electric restructuring plan provides substantial transition cost recovery and allows the company to transfer its generating facilities. CGE plans to transfer its generating assets to CIN's non-regulated affiliate, Cinergy Wholesale Energy, Inc. Another CIN subsidiary, PSI, remains a vertically integrated regulated company and restructuring is not expected in the mid-term. Regulated operations provide about 55% of earnings.
CIN, through its subsidiaries CGE and PSI, provides electric and gas service in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana to about 1.5 million electric and 500,000 gas customers. The company also has a growing merchant energy business and owns 13,000 megawatts of generation.

With reference to our telephone conversation of last Friday, I talked to Jaime Alatorre.
He will not be  able to be with Mr. Haedicke tomorrow Tuesday Oct. 16 at 2:00 o'clock, as he already had made an appoitnment.
He mentioned that maybe the best time would be after finishing the staff meeting. (He thinks Mr. Haedicke will

Do you think they could meet tomorrow at around 5:15 pm.?
If this is not possible, he will talk to you later, as he is out of the office in a Seminar this morning.

In furtherance of the message which I left for you, please find attached a
copy of a replacement guarantee for your review.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of
guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the
project, the
US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to
guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US
L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the "Existing Guarantee"), is to be
replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy
entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).

As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with
revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which
Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations
of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas
purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron
Canada Corp. (the "ECC Physical Master") as well as the master physical gas
purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North
America Corp. (the "ENA Physical Master").   Russell had allocated US$15
million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and
US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.

Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an
"Amended and Restated" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of
significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee
(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have
prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas
Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to
ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking
for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement
guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the
Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to
Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which
I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master
and the appropriate contact information for notices).

When you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined
replacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the
Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.

Thanks for your help.

Note to Russell:  Russell, you were going to confirm for me that the existing
Enron Corp. guarantee delivered to Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage
Energy US L.P. to secure the obligations of Enron Canada Corp., Enron North
America Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (in the amount of $35 million)
dated June 1, 1998 is NOT to be replaced.  Has there been any progress on
this front?

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. "Professional Services" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.

The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal.
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to
Desk" is selected.
2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their
stuff, they should see their side.

GRAY DAVIS' NEW RADIO ADS CONTINUE CAMPAIGN OF LIES AND HALF-TRUTHS
DAVIS CLAIMS CREDIT FOR POWER PLANTS LAUNCHED BEFORE HE EVEN TOOK OFFICE

The launching of statewide radio ads by the Gray Davis campaign, a full 16
months ahead of Election Day, should not come to anyone's surprise.  Nor
should anyone be surprised that the new radio ads are full of the typical
Davis lies and half-truths.

Davis has made raising money for his re-election campaign the #1 goal of his
administration, and obviously that money will be spent to twist Davis'
failed record for those who don't know better. The real news in these ads is
the brazen half-truths that permeate these so-called "energy updates."

The ads are billed as almost public service announcements, but in a real
public service, we here at Russo Marsh + Rogers have to set the record
straight with the entire story:

"Of the 16 new power plants Gray Davis seems to be claiming credit for
almost personally developing and constructing, he actually deserves credit
for none!"

Here are the facts:  Of the 16 plants Davis takes credit for, every single
one was first planned for construction and siting before Davis even became
governor.

Ten actually began the licensing process or applied for state certification
before Davis' term in office began.

And the final 6 plants?  Building a power plant is a major undertaking.
Feasibility studies by the plant builder begin months before the first piece
of paper arrives at the Energy Commission.  If you assume that the builder
of a plant first started internal studies only twelve months before their
first license application, then guess what?  They were started under the
previous administration too!

Furthermore, Gray Davis did not appoint his third member of the 5-member
California Energy Commission until February 2001!  And even that third
appointee was a reappointment of Bill Keese, who was originally appointed by
you guessed it, Pete Wilson, "father of deregulation and all things evil in
California."

The truth is that while Gray Davis is boasting of personally licensing these
16 new plants - the heavy load was carried by the previous administration.
Davis is desperately trying to spin his way out of an energy disaster
created when he fiddled away precious time last year, denied utilities the
right to long-term contracting and falsely insisted he was on top of the
energy "challenge."

The Gray Davis spin machine now takes on a new phase with his $30 million
campaign war chest to rewrite history.   It's no news at all that his
desperate first campaign ads are filled with the same half-truths he's been
repeating since day one.

Fortunately, the RM+R Insider will be here for you, every time, to serve as
the "Truth Squad" against Gray's distortions.

Hi, Mitch!  As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version of
open access.  As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.  Only
non-residential customers are eligible for direct access.  Utilities need not
sell any generating resources.  We will use a technique called "ongoing
valuation" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while still
receiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.  We are
planning to be in balance (or long) for 2002 on a full load basis.  Thus,
while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentially
fully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.  We have
also begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a full
load position for years beyond 2002.  Those discussions will probably continue
the next couple of months.  One possible outcome is that we would fill all of
our load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.  They would have the right to
"opt-out" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03.
Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller load
customers on a set schedule.  This would allow us some certainty and ability
to make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty about
what load might be available when.  Everyone is well-aware of our short
position and the implications of that.  We are seeking an amendment to
Oregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on our
ability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.  I
think this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a cliff
like California did or Nevada appears to be doing.  All this being said,
whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately an
emotional/political issue.  Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,
could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several bills
already introduced to delay/reverse it.  We will keep you informed.
Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to plan
for almost everyone indefinitely.

I think based upon your discussions with staff and the commissioners you are
the best one to respond to this question.  Thanks

In the resource plan that you sent me earlier this week, you indicated that
PGE was short anywhere from 400 to 700 MW, going out to 2006. What
sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open accesss? (In Nevada, where
I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer
delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year,
how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the
OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access?

*****************************************************************

In volatile markets like this one, sectors behave in radically different
ways. Here's what you need to know to find today's best opportunities.

When the economy is purring along, most stock groups rise and fall
together. But amid uncertainty and turmoil, different groups suffer at
different times and rebound with varying delays. That's what's been
happening this year, and investors preparing for 2001 need to examine each
sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk.

Since January, there have been three big divergences in the market. The
first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups. The second has
been between issues with high P/Es and those with low P/Es. And the third
has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with
small caps.

After many months of leadership, tech stocks peaked in March and have
declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated. Technology
companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming
quarters, and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual
investors began reducing their exposure. By Thanksgiving, even the
strongest and most popular tech stocks, including Cisco and Oracle, were
down a third or more from their highs. And even at current levels the
stocks aren't cheap with P/Es as high as 50. They'll be vulnerable to
further declines until it's clear that the economy has completed its
downswing.

By contrast, consumer stocks (which are defensive because they aren't as
tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are) benefited from investors'
flight to safety. After having dropped by a third to less than $60 a share
in March, Procter & Gamble [PG] rebounded 35 percent to $74. And
Anheuser-Bush [BUD] has rallied more than 70 percent over the same period
to $48. Those stocks are now trading at more than 20 times next year's
earnings, so they're no longer exceptionally cheap. But such defensive
issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been
overloaded in tech.

Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector, but they
were helped even more by this year's sharp runup in the price of oil.
ExxonMobil [XOM], one of the most conservative international oil companies,
has gained 20 percent since March to $89 a share. I doubt, however, that
oil can remain above $30 a barrel for more than a year or two -- today's
high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce
demand. As a result, I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of
their gains.

While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business,
oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications. Fiercely
competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they
have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further
equipment purchases. The result is that stocks throughout the sector --
from service providers like AT&T [T] and WorldCom [WCOM] to equipment
manufacturers like Lucent [LU] -- have lost more than half their value
since the spring. Statistically, I think stocks in the group are
undervalued by a third, but they still may represent dead money for the
next six months.

These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of
the roiling market, but they aren't the only one. The largest U.S.
companies have average P/Es in the mid-20s, and the most popular giants
have P/Es double or nearly triple historical levels. By contrast, small
companies -- those with market caps of less than $3.5 billion -- have
average P/Es of below 18.

From all these cross-currents, two important ideas emerge. At any point
there's likely to be at least one sector that's deeply undervalued. Don't
try to predict the turns -- just buy one or two of the blue chips in the
sector that looks cheapest. Right now, defensive stocks are still in an
uptrend but they're no longer cheap, while the techs are still falling
(their decline isn't over yet). You can either buy good tech values and
ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out. The
other important idea is that high-P/E blue-chip growth stocks are way
overvalued compared with everything else. Of course, those are the stocks
everyone most wants to own. But be smart -- diversify with a value fund or
a fund that holds mid- and small-caps with an average P/E below 20. They're
out there.

Future Looks Dark for New York Market;

York City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that contin=
ue
to take their own toll on the stability of the market.

Various stakeholders in the New York market have now begun to place blame o=
n
each other in advance of what could shape up to be a very problematic summe=
r.
As noted, in its new report, NYSEG, a subsidiary of Energy East (NYSE: EAS)=
,
is especially critical of NYISO, which it says has contributed to soaring=

wholesale prices in New York. NYSEG also blames NYISO for outlining
unrealistic goals for new power supply, not providing accurate price signal=
s
to energy customers, and for not doing enough to solve immediate problems. =


Yet, beyond the finger pointing, some essential facts can be established, o=
n
which both NYSEG and the NYISO apparently agree. According to data included=

in the NYISO report, between 1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New=

York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity under contract in the state
increased only by 1,060 MW. New York has not brought a new plant online sin=
ce
1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven year=
s
since a 1,000 MW unit in Oswego, N.Y. marked the last plant to open upstate=
.

In addition, New York suffers from severe transmission bottlenecks. Deficie=
nt
transmission systems in central New York, around New York City and at the=

outlining borders to other states and Canada limit the amount of power than=

can be imported into the state. New York City is relatively isolated from t=
he
transmission grids that serve the rest of the state and must rely heavily o=
n
city-based power supply. New York City's load should reach 10,535 MW this=

summer alone, requiring 8,428 MW of in-city capacity, along with imports, t=
o
meet demand and provide a reserve margin. With a current capacity of 8,132=

MW, there is a potential 296 MW shortfall. These projections presume normal=

weather conditions. If New York experiences a warmer-than-normal summer, th=
e
outlook gets even worse.

Further, according to a report from New York's State Attorney General,
between 1988 and 1998 capital improvements to New York's transmission syste=
m
dropped from $307.7 million per year to $90 million per year. At the presen=
t
time, only one major addition to the transmission system in the state is
scheduled. A proposed underwater line linking Long Island to Connecticut
would provide Long Island with about 300 MW of additional power and increas=
e
its import capacity by about 4 percent. Unless this transmission expansion =
is
expedited, it is not scheduled for operation until 2002.

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York most=

certainly will be strained this summer when warmer temperatures drive up th=
e
use of air conditioners, pushing demand to annual highs. While NYSEG and th=
e
NYISO may agree on the nature of New York's problems, a contentious debate=

has emerged with regard to finding a solution. In its own proposal, release=
d
in early March, the NYISO focused on building new generation, expediting
siting processes, improving transmission lines, and conservation efforts. I=
n
one of its key proposals, the NYISO urged the creation of 8,600 MW of new=

electricity (roughly 30 percent of New York's peak demand) by 2005, with up=

to 5,000 MW of that generation being made available by the end of 2001.

NYSEG immediately denounced the plan for "falling short in its assessment o=
f
the magnitude of the crisis" and issued its own proposals in its recent
report. For instance, NYSEG officials said that NYISO had "grossly
oversimplified the situation" and that, considering the tenuous state of
power construction in New York, the objective of establishing 8,600 MW by=

2005 was "extremely unrealistic." In turn, NYSEG says that a robust wholesa=
le
electric market will not materialize in New York until 2008, assuming that=

measures to repair the problems in the state are taken immediately. In earl=
y
March, NYSEG released the "NYSEGPlan," outlining six steps which it believe=
s
"contain the real solutions to ensure a successful transition" to a
competitive market in New York. In summary, the NYSEGPlan includes:

Streamlining the siting and approval process to build new generating plants=
.
Adding to the state's transmission capacity.
Adding to the state's natural-gas supply infrastructure.
Creating a regional transmission organization to increase supply liquidity.=

Reinforcing the need for wise energy use by all consumers, by encouraging=

interruptible load where feasible, and building the technological
infrastructure necessary for real-time pricing.
Approving the NYSEG Price Protection Plan, in which electric rates would be=

frozen for seven years, by July 1, 2001.

However, while NYSEG criticized NYISO for espousing unrealistic goals, the=

same obstacles inherent in New York's market might also thwart its own ener=
gy
plan. For instance, topping the list of NYSEG's six steps is an emphasis on=

establishing new generation in New York through a streamlined siting and
approval process. This may be easier said than done. As I mentioned in my=

3/22/01IssueAlert, the opposition to new power plants in New York equals th=
e
lobbying force that community groups in California wield. In that column, I=

discussed the fact that Sithe Energies has downscaled a proposed plant in=

Ramapo, N.Y. (from an 827-MW combined-cycle facility to a 510-MW peaking
unit) due to opposition raised by local residents.

In addition, just yesterday, a New York Supreme Court judged blocked effort=
s
by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to build two 44-MW gas-fired
generators in the borough of Queens. The Supreme Court judge order NYPA to=

"cease all construction on the units" and ruled that the power authority
violated state environmental-review laws to its efforts to rush the plant=

into service by June. In response, NYPA has said that the plants=01*along w=
ith
nine others that it is hoping to build throughout New York City=01*are need=
ed to
prevent power outages this summer. NYPA continues to face fierce opposition=

from community groups (many of them launching lawsuits) who do not want the=

generation units in their neighborhoods.

Consequently, the supply / demand imbalance in New York is a very serious=

matter, and one that residents in the state may not fully appreciate unless=

blackouts occur. Until the core problem of insufficient transmission lines=

surrounding New York State and New York City are solved, adding new power=

supply (assuming that generation development can move past community
opposition) would not be enough to bring more balance to the market. In the=

interim, conservation efforts may truly be the only tool that New Yorkers c=
an
user to abate power outages this summer, but again the general public may n=
ot
fully understand the need to reduce their power usage.

New York basically has three options at this point to prepare for near-term=

problems. First, expedite the building of new generation sources (including=

distribution generation alternatives). This assumes that gas lines will be=

sufficient to import necessary fuel. Second, allow the economy of New York=

City to stagnate as a result of the supply / demand imbalance, which will=

drive residents out of the city and in turn reduce demand. And, third, focu=
s
on conservation efforts, which again may not work until residents are
directly impacted by outages. The city may choose a combination of all thre=
e
approaches or decide to focus on just one. However, to address the immediat=
e
concerns, it does not appear that New York has any options besides this
three-tier approach.

One point that bears mentioning is the similarity between California and Ne=
w
York regarding the position that both states took on divestiture. Although =
it
is not completely accurate to say that either state officially mandated
divestiture, utilities in both California and New York felt intense pressur=
e
to divest and submitted restructuring plans that included the sale of most =
of
their power plants. NYSEG, the author of the new report on New York's power=

problems, is one utility that sold all of its generation assets and will
remain only in the transmission business. This most likely creates a
heightened sensitivity on NYSEG's part with regard to the power supply
shortages presently facing New York. Again, we now have two states that
represent the array of problems that can result when the vertical utility=

model becomes dismantled. Of course, it is not fair to say that divestiture=

is the sole source of the current problems in California and New York, but=

taking away a utility's ability to effectively control is own power supply=

costs certainly contributed to the vulnerability in both states.

A few updates:

I had some additional conversations yesterday with Randy Young.  Randy is
making some changes to my org. chart but is reasonably comfortable with his
people showing up in Global Assets as a group.  I'm trying to confirm with
Frank Sayre that all of his CALME folks are now in another legal group and
that no one needs to appear on the Global Assets chart.  If I can talk to
Randy one more time today and confirm with Frank, my org. chart should be
good to go.  I passed it by Jim Hughes and have forwarded it to Rob for any
thoughts.

I'm heading to Singapore to meet with the Dahbol legal team (inhouse and
outside counsel) to strategize re events in India.  There have been a number
of articles in the India press in which relevant officials state that "a
high-level group" is being established to "prepare a case" against Dahbol
Phase II and to find any "flaws" in the revised PPA.  Some articles have even
talked about cancelling Phase II.  While Dahbol Power Company has received
nothing official threatening DPC, it is now the internal Enron consensus that
something is likely to emerge.

Bill Krenz is currently in China.  I don't know if you were ever updated
about the dismissal of Soon Yeap and his two closest allies/employees, but
I'll give you 2-3 minutes sometime.  Bill is closing the loop on some
formalities of their departure and helping with the investigation of other
irregularities that Accounting has discovered in the Beijing office.

Jim and Rebecca are turning to understanding Cuiba's problems.  Rebecca has
some meetings today and Monday.

Jim, thanks for the note.  Please forward this on to Clint Walden, Rick Causey and Rod Hayslett (and anyone else you think needs this information)

I have a couple of comments on the conditions below that were discussed on the phone but were not included in the list below.  We would expect a
representation from the Board as well as outside legal counsel on point #4 below.  Also, I assume this review is a condition precedent in the debt
documents.  Enron should be aware that there may be issues that arise that do not allow us to complete our work in the timetable necessary and should
consider whether wording the loan documents relating to this cp should be modified to describe the review as something that is a condition precendent
"if it is professionally able to be completed."   Also, all of these conditions assume there are no financial obligations from the entities in
the reviews from or to Enron corp.  If so, those contractual relationships will need to be evaluted to determine if "overhang" issues combined with
the financial obligations might preclude us from completing our review.   This is a high priority item.  I would ask that the company assist us in
immediately identifying and evaluating those financial obligations, if any,  to determine if significant issues exist.  We can get started now on that.
Please call Heather Mueck and Chris Herbold.  I would like to get that identification work completed by end of business tomorrow.  Heather and
Gerrad will be leading the review work and Chris will be assisting also.

Overall debt questions.  We need to understand terms, conditions and debt documents.  Who has these? We are ready to start reviewing today.

Financial statements and review work. What periods are going to be included in the documents? The comment below says quarterly.  Which quarters?
Year-to-date? Comparison to prior years? We would expect a full set of financial statements with footnotes for all periods presented (balance
sheets, income statements and cash flows?   Who is drafting the footnote that describes the overhang issues? This is a high priority item that will
get much review and scrutiny. l would like to get the Company's signed off footnote disclosure on the "overhang" issues tomorrow.  Also, we will need
immediate access to the financials and your people to answer questions. When can we get the financials that will be included in the deal.  I assume
Enron personnel will be available to answer questions 24/7 beginning today to complete this work in the necessary timeframe?

I know these are many questions.  More to come I am sure.  But I also want to get started and focused on time consuming issues.  We will be
determining our expanded scope procedures that are referred to below.

My understanding from legal was that Corporate Development as represented by Donahue and the business unit had to sign off.  He brought Mordaunt into the picture for his legal side.  I don't like going outside of EA anymore than you do, but according to established policy relayed to me through legal stand still and non-solicitation language requires this type of sign off.

EMAILTEXT:
Attached please find this week's legislative report.  Most of the action
this week centered around the budget conference committee hearing as the
deadline to pass the state's budget is next Friday, June 15th.  Also,
today was the last day for bills to pass out of their house of origin and
sent to the other house for legislative hearings.  This week's energy
highlights include the following:

EVENTS:

* Governor Davis sends letter to the state PUC President Loretta
Lynch, urging that California's petroleum refineries and ancillary
facilities be exempt from rotating outages. The basis for the governor's
letter is his stated belief that even a brief disruption of electricity
for these facilities can shut down production and supply of petroleum
products for several weeks. "The availability of petroleum derived
transportation fuels is critical to the public health and safety of
Californians. Public safety agencies such as law enforcement, emergency
medical care responders, and the military all rely on these fuels. Without
petroleum fuels, the ability of these essential-use customers to perform
their critical functions would be seriously impaired," said Governor
Davis.

* Governor Davis, along with top executives and business leaders in
the state, announce a joint-Declaration on Thursday committed to saving 20
percent in overall electricity consumption. With more than 140 businesses
and organizations statewide, this "energy-conservation" coalition sets the
following goals among others to reduce energy use: (1) set temperatures
for occupied space to 78 degrees from May to October; (2) reduce lighting
levels by 25 percent and an additional 25 percent upon the declaration of
a Stage II emergency; (3) close blinds and shades when possible; and (4)
turn off and unplug all office and kitchen equipment when not in use.

* QFs will have to wait until next Wednesday to hear whether or not
the state Public Utilities Commission forces utilities to pay 15 percent
of back payments to some alternative-energy generators.  The PUC postponed
their vote to June 13 on a proposal that would allow alternative
generators who need the money to continue making electricity to ask for it
from PG&E and Edison to remain in business.

* The California State Senate Rules Committee, in cooperation with the
Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the Wholesale
Energy Market, agrees on Tuesday to issue subpoenas to provide further
background information in its investigation into whether generators are
illegally profiteering from the state's power crisis. Eight out-of-state
generating companies (and perhaps, eventually, the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power and the state Department of Water Resources) stand to
receive papers demanding documents on bidding, pricing, and other aspects
of power sales in the state. Those companies will be Reliant Energy,
Dynegy Energy Services, Inc., Williams Energy, Enron Corp., NRG Energy
Inc., Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., and AES Corp.

* Governor Davis signs Executive Order D-37-01 on Monday aimed at
increasing small business participation in state contracting. This order
mandates state agencies to push for an annual 25 percent small business
participation level in state contracting and authorizes the Department of
General Services (DGS) to streamline the small business certification
process, increase the pool of certified small businesses, establish a
Prompt Payment Advocate, and implement a state-sponsored Economic
Conference and Opportunity Fair focusing on enhancing contracting
opportunities for small businesses.


LEGISLATION

* Property taxation bill -- AB 81 by Assembly Member Carole Migden
(D-San Francisco) -- passes out of the full Assembly on Thursday with 43
AYES and 28 NOES. This bill would return the tax assessment authority over
electric-generating facilities back to the state Board of Equalization,
thereby nullifying "Rule 905." Although the author asserted that her bill
will not take away much-needed tax revenue from cities and counties, AB 81
is considered a huge disincentive and unfair tax on current and potential
electric generating companies in the state. IEP testified against this
bill in committee and will continue to oppose this bill in the Senate.

* Assembly Member Cohn (D-Saratoga) gains Assembly approval on
Wednesday with 47 AYES and 13 NOES for her resolution asking the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to "impose interim price caps until the
California power market has stabilized.''  Assembly Joint Resolution 11
(AJR 11) specifically states that price caps be put in place at least
until California is able to bring new energy supplies on-line and for the
state's massive conservation efforts to take effect. The resolution
asserts that California believes not enough has been done by the FERC to
investigate price gouging by generators and control wholesale electricity
prices and calls upon the federal regulatory agency to "adhere to its
governing statutes, its vision statement, and its own regulations for
companies seeking market-based authority."

* Path 15 study bill passes out of the full Assembly on Tuesday with
unanimous support from both sides with 69 AYES and 0 NOES. If passed by
the Senate, AB 460 by Assembly Member Phil Wyman (R-Tehachapi) will
allocate $10 million from the California Energy Commission to the
Transmission Authority of Northern California for environmental studies to
see if this transmission-line group between Northern and Southern
California can be expanded.

* Senate Bill 39xx: Public Utilities by Senator Jackie Speier
(D-Hillsborough) and Assembly Bill 28xx: Electrical restructuring: Oversight
Board: Independent System Operator by Assembly Member Migden, both
originally to be heard in committee next Monday and Tuesday respectively,
have both been rescheduled to a to-be-announced later date. SB 39xx
"clarifies and enhances the state's PUC over in-state electric generating
facilities" while AB 28xx "expands the authority of the Electricity
Oversight Board and the ISO."

* Assembly Bill 35xx: Department of Water Resources: electrical
energy: eminent domain by Assembly Member Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) is
scheduled to be heard in the Assembly Judiciary Committee this upcoming
Tuesday. This bill would require the state Public Works Board to acquire
eminent domain proceedings for the possession and use of real property for
the generation of electrical power. This real property would be "paid for at
fair market value" and put under the control of the state Department of
Water Resources.  IEP opposes this bill, and will testify in opposition at
the hearing.

The Governor of CA and a bipartisan leadership of the state legislature met=

with major generators including qualifying facilities, marketers, utility=

regulators and federal officials to discuss the electricity situation in CA=
.
Recognizing the importance of the issue as laid out in the Governor=01,s St=
ate
of the State speech last evening, the partipants agreed for the need for
cooperation to maintain stability and avoid bankruptcy for the utilities an=
d
assure the long term regulation of market conditions.  Crucial elements of=

the solution include:

? The development of approaches to promote long-term purchases of electrici=
ty
possibily by States and generators at an attractive fixed rate - an
option-type of an idea perhaps using some type of existing state agency lik=
e
DWR - Dept. of Water and Resources to basically create the credit and
insulation for suppliers from the utilities.

? The willingness for generators, qualifying facilities and markets to
provide on the short-term basis for current amounts owed by PGE and Edison =
in
the context of the framework of a long-term solution

? The need to find satisfactory approaches with respect to the obligation=

accumulation of the utilitles for the purchase of power consistent with
contractual obligations and which are in the public interest.

? Cooperation to better match supply and demand in the short and long-term.

? Review of the existing qualifying facilities payments to directors.

The parties ackknoweldge the problem must be addresed while taking into
account the regional market.  Further working groups will be convened on
Wednesday, and there will be two working groups to address to address
technical details.  Principals will reconvene this weekend.  One working
group will deal with long-term auction and QF issues.  The first and the la=
st
bullets and the second and the third bullets which have to do more with the=

arrearages, the debt and the obligations that have been accumulated for the=

purchase of the power is the second  working group.

I think I=01,ve read it all.  The working groups (see first and last bullet=

Sue is best equipped to handle.  If we need to send another person over wit=
h
Sue to sit on the second working group that deals with the unrecovered and=

unpaid obligations of the utilites.  Sarah Novosel should do that.

My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase:

The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to
the Delivery Point.   The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port.   Without any other
documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is
Brazilian Trust's.   I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben
Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some
storage costs.

(Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor
where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a
dispute at hand.)

I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the
equipment until we take it out of storage.

As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is
as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to
Brazilian Trust,  Brazilian Trust delivers to the port  and keeps risk of
loss until Ex Terra, at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase
Agreement transfers to NEPCO, but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of
loss at ExTerra.  Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure.

I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC
contract and is protected by clause 8.1 of the EPC Contract.

Under what authority is NEPCO transporting the equipment from the GE
delivery point to Exterra, has Brazilian Trust engaged NEPCO to do so?  The
Turbine Purchase Agreement does not contemplate this.

2.0  David Gohlke-  I think we have a small hole that needs and can be easily
filled.  In the Turbine Purchase Agreement, can we have NEPCO perform
transport service from the GE delivery point to Exterra but BT keeps ROL.

3.0 I think from a GE perspective,  the Enron family takes ROL from GE at
Jacinto port and gets the turbines delivered to  the Site.

4.0  Kay Mann - I really need a copy of the Ben letter- we start moving
equipment shortly- I need to make sure that the ROL issue with GE is
adequately covered.

Gang,

Apparently there has been some miscommunication from the folks at National
Bank of Canada.   My understanding had been that the Master ISDA between
Garden State and NBC would be exactly the same as the Master ISDA between ENA
and NBC except the $1mm threshold.  This is not the case.  The attached
documents are what they believe should be the draft documents which have the
$1mm threshold difference and an environmental reference that is different.
Can you please take a little time and quickly look through the document and
see what else might be different. I'd like to get a general feel for what is
different so that I can decide the best way to deal with this.

Station 4 overhaul meeting.

Today discussions took place in reference to the overhaul work scopes for all three units at station 4. Participants included  Jonny Hendricks, Randy Johnson, Rick Smith, Matt Frances, and myself. From the Gallup team we had Pat Troncoso, Walt Rhoda, and Robert Stearns. We also had Roy Smith on the Phone for discussion on unit 401.

During discussions on unit 401 which is the line bore project we discussed option to correct bearing problems related to the alignment on unit 401. It was suggested  that the problem could probably be corrected by installing a custom built bearing in the journal that appears to be out of align with the rest. We are making arrangements to take the unit down so that measurement can be taken so the custom bearing can be built. By going this route the outage time required to complete will be significantly reduced as will as the overall cost. The original outage was 40 days. Now we should be able to complete the work indicated on the scope in about 14 days. We are still planning to complete the compressor work that was in the scope along with R&R on turbo coolers and some miner upper end work.

Scope of work for unit 402, and 403 remains pretty much the same. The only thing that was changed from the original scope was the plan to change all main bearings on both units. At this time we do not see any reason for that so none will be changed. The Gallup team plans to boreascope the units during there upcoming outage for maintenance. If anything is identified by the team or by Matt during the analysis we will make the appropriate arrangements to cover that cost during our outage.

Please take a look at the attached scopes to verify that the changes we discussed are complete and nothing is left out.

Thanks for everyone's participation!

We are moving forward to transfer the positions from the emissions books (SO2
and NOx) to the coal group at close of business 5/23/00.  The SO2 marks for
both the underlying and volatility positions currently in the 2007 through
2010 timeframe create a value differential of $2.6 million between our
evaluation and their marks.  For the sake of not continuing the unproductive
task of negotiating this value, we will move forward to transfer despite our
differences.

I strongly recommend continuing to use and pay for all personnel in risk,
documentation and settlement that currently perform these duties for
emissions.
I would like to utilize these resources until further notice.  I am not
comfortable committing to any transfer of risk, documentation and settlement
duties until we have the time to evaluate this further.  I would appreciate
if you could help on this matter to ensure a smooth transition.

Credit and Direct Access




Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be
filed on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and
Commissioner Bilas.  Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in
everything I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some
significant  editing.  Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with
Bilas' request  for parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.  The
draft offers a  compromise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the
Angelides memo.   Also, notice that Section VI urges the Commission to
bifurcate the DA and PX  credit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it
must, but more leisurely on  the PX credit subject.

Finally, I have a suggestion in the form of a question.  How  would AReM
members feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?  There  is
cross-membership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised
in the separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.  This draft
would requires some modifications so as to refer to the "Joint Parties" as
opposed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might  add a section dealing more
explicitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill
stipulation  signed in the first place.  Otherwise, the document would stay
much as it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).
Please let  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF
draft.   Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which
will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not
proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.  Thanks for your help!
Comments as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity.
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out
again on
Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I
missed you.
Talk to you soon.

As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the
underpayment of $60,000.  I need the attachment which I have identified as
merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We
discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to
the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will
cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).  Also, instead
of the term "Sonoco Price", I would prefer the caption "Floating Price
recognized by Sonoco".  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks. Sara

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go,
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice -
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad?
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd,
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

Broadcom Introduces High-Performance Single-Chip All-CMOS Bluetooth Radi=
o   MONTE CARLO, Monaco, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Bluetooth Congress =
2001   Blutonium(TM) Chip Combines Radio and Baseband Functions on         =
Monolithic High-Performance Single-Chip Transceiver  Broadcom Corporation=
(Nasdaq:BRCM), the leading provider of integrated circuits enabling broadb=
and communications, today introduced the Broadcom(R) BCM2033 single-chip tr=
ansceiver for Bluetooth(TM) wireless applications. Integrating previously d=
eveloped, Bluetooth-compliant radio and baseband components onto a single h=
igh-performance integrated circuit, the chip minimizes component counts and=
board space requirements while providing a high-performance solution to th=
e Bluetooth short-range wireless connectivity challenges faced by equipment=
manufacturers.   The Blutonium(TM) BCM2033 achieves the highest performanc=
e of any single-chip Bluetooth transceiver in the industry, combining Bluet=
ooth-qualified radio and baseband circuits onto a single monolithic chip. O=
n-board Fractional-N synthesizer technology allows the chip to work with pr=
actically any reference frequency available. This is especially useful in c=
urrent and third generation (3G) cellular phones in which a wide variety of=
crystal oscillators are available. Featuring high levels of integration an=
d minimal off-chip filters or other active components, the BCM2033 provides=
excellent performance in the presence of radio interferers and is ideally =
suited for harsh radio frequency (RF) environments, such as inside mobile p=
hones and laptop computers. In addition, the chip's unique design allows it=
to maintain its high performance even across the extended temperature rang=
e of between -40 and +105 degrees centigrade, an accomplishment unparallele=
d in the industry.   "With our previously announced Blutonium products, we =
demonstrated our unique ability to achieve outstanding radio performance de=
signing chips in a standard digital CMOS process," said K.C. Murphy, Vice P=
resident and General Manager of Broadcom's RF and Advanced Mixed Signal Bus=
iness Unit. "We've now applied Broadcom's well-known integration expertise =
by combining RF and digital circuits onto a single substrate while maintain=
ing unmatched performance among Bluetooth transceivers. As a result, we're =
unveiling the single-chip Bluetooth transceiver the industry has been waiti=
ng for, with performance exceeding that of practically any other solution, =
regardless of the process technology."   The BCM2033 is based upon Broadcom=
's previous all-CMOS stand-alone radios and basebands that have already ach=
ieved Bluetooth Version 1.1 qualification and which exceed the Bluetooth sp=
ecification in most areas. This means that devices such as mobile phones an=
d PC cards built using Blutonium components are compatible with the latest =
version of the Bluetooth specification, easing the process by which these d=
evices can apply the Bluetooth logo to their products. The BCM2033 benefits=
from this previous development, achieving strong performance in key areas =
such as linearity and receiver sensitivity, attaining a sensitivity figure =
of better than -82 dBm.   Integration of the previously developed circuits =
onto a single chip was made possible because the entire Blutonium line, lik=
e all Broadcom chip products, was developed in a standard digital CMOS (or =
Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) manufacturing process. No other pr=
ocess allows the combination of RF and digital circuits on a single transce=
iver.   "By first proving our radio and baseband architectures in CMOS with=
standalone products, we've chosen to emphasize performance in our Bluetoot=
h component development program," said Scott Bibaud, Director of Marketing =
for Broadcom's Bluetooth Products. "With these multiple Blutonium elements =
integrated onto a single cost-effective chip, we can now leverage Broadcom'=
s proven reputation for operational excellence and provide these components=
in production quantities to our customers around the world."   Key Feature=
s  The BCM2033 has been designed to provide very high performance in Blueto=
oth applications with a single transceiver. Notable features include:   -- =
Strong spurious emissions performance -- the BCM2033 minimizes     interfe=
rence from transmissions taking place in the bands used by     mobile phone=
s, providing robust connections between Bluetooth     devices.  --  Excepti=
onal blocking performance -- the highly linear design     eliminates the ne=
ed for costly off-chip RF filtering to receive     reliable signals from ot=
her Bluetooth devices.  --  Fractional-N Synthesizer -- this synthesizer en=
ables the 2033 to     use any existing frequency reference, including those=
commonly     available in mobile phones such as CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, GPRS, an=
d     UMTS, eliminating the need for an off-chip crystal.  --  Extensive so=
ftware support -- the BCM2033 is software-compatible     with protocol stac=
ks developed by leading third party stack     vendors, as well as with Broa=
dcom's internal stack.  --  Cost-effective memory architecture -- on-chip m=
emory eliminates     the need for off-chip flash while allowing the use of =
additional     memory when appropriate.  --  Requires minimal off-chip comp=
onents -- by eliminating all     external active components, the BCM2033 re=
quires just a few     passive components, providing very limited bill of ma=
terials (BOM)     and board space impact on OEM equipment designs.     Avai=
lability  The version of the BCM2033 with no external memory bus is package=
d in a 64-pin fine pitch Ball Grid Array (fpBGA) and the version with exter=
nal flash interfaces is packaged in a 100-pin fpBGA. The transceiver is sam=

Dzien dobry. Many thanks for agreeing to take the remainder of the VaR
seminar - it is a great help. I asked Raymond Yeow of Enron Australia if he
would chair day one but he said that you would be a bigger draw and perhaps
better placed. To this end, I am hoping that you would consider chairing day
one's plenary session and trading stream. You can blame Raymond for
recommending you!  I appreciate that this is asking even more of you than
you originally signed up for but you seem to be famous in this small market
and it would be great if you could do it.
I apologise for imposing once again but look forward to hearing back from
you when you get a chance. As ever, let me know if you have any questions.

I really love you.  I can't wait to be with you this weekend.  I bet you are glad you listened to me and did not buy any Enron stock at $21, considering it is at $18 today!!!

Love you,

Hey guys,
Here is Chris Choby's e-mail.  He might not respond right away because he is
on a ship and the e-mail sometimes does not go through right away.  Hope all
is well and talk to you soon.

Diane,

This is the headcount projection for 2002. I am slightly above my plan for 2001
that I am under performing now.

Sorry for the delay.

I know your schedule is very busy, as is mine. This means we don't get to
talk much and catch up. I just want you to know that we really appreciate
your help on the many fronts you are fighting, including MSEB/MERC, Metgas,
LNG shipping policy, Electricity Act 2000, Derivatives trading, etc. It is a
great comfort to know that we have someone dedicated to this function who
brings so much personal history and knowledge as well as access to the larger
Enron regulatory family.

I get very positive feedback from all who interact with you, both internally
and externally. Keep up the good work.

FYI.  The attached briefing isn't great news for consumers in the Western
markets.  The key conclusion is that:

"CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, however, with
power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices and little
relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather."

Latest NFL Player News

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1515&>, WR CAR - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/26/01
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. "They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be," Jeffers said. "I'm excited. It's another step along the way." Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays.

Ryan Leaf  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright.

Clint Stoerner  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas.

Edgerrin James  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=133320&>, RB IND - President Taft Updated 10/26/01
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4.

Derrick Alexander  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 10/25/01
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.

James Hodgins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.

Dave Stachelski  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.

Michael Bennett  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.

Todd Heap  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.

Anthony Thomas  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235248&>, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 10/25/01
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.

Kevin Swayne  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.

Reggie Swinton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.

Dedric Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01

Terry Allen  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/25/01
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.

Jason Brookins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report.

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/25/01
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.

Freddie Jones  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1843&>, TE SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 10/25/01
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report.

Hines Ward  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01

Joey Galloway  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 10/25/01
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.

Charlie Batch  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12204&>, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/25/01
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.

Jerome Pathon  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 10/25/01
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.

Terry Glenn  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1254&>, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/25/01
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills.

Chad Morton  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.

Marco Battaglia  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.

Chad Johnson  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.

Chris Sanders  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=4510&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 10/25/01

Steve Williams has asked the question of whether Wright and the US could get
back to East Texas if (i) Judge Downes grants the Wright defendants' Motion
to Dismiss for Failure to Plead Fraud With Particularity but gives Wright
leave to amend, (ii) Judge Downes dismisses Grynberg with prejudice (since
this is Grynberg II and he has already had a second chance), and (iii) after
(ii), Wright, instead of amending in Wyoming, simply files a new complaint
in East Texas (with no pending Grynberg complaint to MDL him back to
Wyoming).  We are looking into this question and thought you might want to
as well.  Are defendants able to get a dismissal with prejudice if a
plaintiff who has been granted leave to amend chooses not to amend?  Would a
better course of proceeding be to file a Motion for a more definite
statement for failure to plead fraud with particularity so that the relief
granted would be an order to plead more definitely rather than an order
granting dismissal (with leave to amend).  If Wright then did not plead with
particularity, a motion to dismiss with prejudice or even a motion for
judgment o the pleadings could be filed.  Your thoughts would be
appreciated.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Thank you for hosting my visit to Enron and arranging for me to meet
with you and other decision-makers at Enron. The meetings been very
productive on my side, as I try to formulate the project more
clearly.

We are entering the period that I have to set up the Research Assistantships
(RA)
for next year for Giuseppe and the other student I have committed to support
on this project. School starts in late September, but already I have to
start putting together the papers for the RAs in the Fall, as per departmental
requirement.

Would it be possible to put the project in place soon, so that I can
do the RAship papers for the students? I expect I will start having
pressure from the department to do the paperwork for these RAships early
September, and I have to have them in place by the third week of September,
just before school starts.

I am attaching below the same DRAFT of a letter I had sent you in a previous
e-mail, which would be required to set up the project at Stanford. Please,
let me know how you would like to proceed.

Again, thanks for your hospitality and I look forward to productive
collaboration
during the coming year and beyond.

in October.

Thanks for the informative phone call this morning.  Having the key issues presented in one place was very helpful.

To follow up on the meeting, the following are action items for the group.

1.	December 1 Market Readiness Update Meeting

Thane Twiggs (wholesale) and Nancy Hetrick (retail) will have at this time an understanding of the billing and settlement issues (or not) with their respective areas.  We need to ensure that EES and EPMI are able to get the necessary information to make sure that their bills and settlements are working and that we can bill our retail customers.  I will ask Linda Noske to set up this meeting.  If anyone hears anything else about the market delay, please let Jean Ryall know immediately.  As of right now, it is my impression that we all agree there is no delay scheduled???

2.	Congestion Pass thru to EES' Retail Customers

Thane Twiggs, Nancy Hetrick and Jim Steffes will get with EWS and EES counter parties to try and work through the ability of EES passing thru congestion to its customers per the contract language.  I will lead the process of consulting with EES legal.

3.	Wholesale Issues (Thane Twiggs)

a.	Define workable TCR Product
b.	End Balanced Schedule requirement
c.	Fix Capacity Auction process, including credit matters
d.	BENA/OOM/AS
e.	Settlement & Billing

4.	Retail Issues

a.	REP - ISO - Utility Interface (Nancy Hetrick)
b.	Reliant PTB (Pat Keene)
c.	TXU PTB (Pat Keene)
d.	Reliant Negative CTC (Pat Keene)
e.	TXU Negative CTC (Pat Keene)
f.	EES / EPMI License (Gloria Ogenyi + Nancy Hetrick)

5.	Information Flow

All policy statements from anyone within Government Affairs should be first vetted with Jean Ryall to ensure consistency and conformity.  Also, all people on the TO: list above should be included on all e-mail traffic.  I know this may sometimes slow down response to business people, but I think that we can all agree that no one has all the information in this very fast moving environment and unless we have a central clearinghouse we may send the wrong messages.

It is also critical that all commercial people interested in Texas need to hear about the latest.  By having Jean Ryall in the center, she will be able to ensure that no one feels "cut out".

The bi-weekly meeting should be held with Jean Ryall as Host to follow these issues in a timely manner.

6.	Wholesale Products

Thane Twiggs was going to keep the team apprised of our products and pricing info on a regular basis so we are informed about the market.

Finally, it is critical that everyone work together to get the best results possible for Enron in the Texas market.  This is our "home" base - we need to make sure that our business efforts win big.

Thanks for everything ya'll have been doing to achieve this result.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused.

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)?

Jeff:
Sorry this took so long but here are my thoughts on the above:

1. In Section 3.1 (c), I'm assuming that the additional sections were added
because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I
think belongs after the phrase that begins, "if the effect of such
failure..."  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals?

3. Section 3.11 should be made subject to Section 5.7 or vice versa.

Bill --

Thanks to you and the Sungard team for your time in Houston last Friday.  The EnronOnline opportunity appears to be a good fit with a number of Sungard's strengths.  I have spent some time debriefing the people on the Enron side, and we believe that it makes sense to continue to pursue our discussions.

We discussed the need for Enron Net Works to get to know Sungard's executive team and to better understand your technical and marketing approach.  I believe the best next step would be a meeting between the appropriate Sungard and Enron executives.  We are a flexible on the location.  Just let me know what date and place works best for the Sungard team.

Your team also expressed interest in learning more about other Enron systems efforts, including DealBench and mid/back office systems.  Let me know if you would like to set up separate meetings to focus on those areas.

made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from

As you may know, Murray Weidenbaum, former Chair of the Council of Economic
Advisors, and Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis
will be the Ken Lay Vinson &Elkins Visiting Scholar at the Jones School for
the period January to May 2001. As he is on sabbatical from Washington
University, he will have no teaching requirements of us but has offered to
give some talks around and about for us.

Since Ken Lay once worked for Murray when Murray was Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury, I wondered if Enron might be interested in jointly sponsoring
a breakfast or luncheon talk by Murray sometime after the first of the
year. He is giving a major address to the Detroit Economic Club in Janurary
and I suspect that he will have the basis for a great talk in Houston as well.

In any event because of the title he will hold and because of our many
joint ventures, I wanted to begin the process of finding a partner in this

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: JASON MESERVE on
Welcome to the Security and Bug Patch Alert newsletter!

Given the recent spate of high-profile denial-of-service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is
clear that security is a major concern in the IT community  as it
should be.

With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center, IT departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running  as well as secure. No chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive
Super Bowl ad.

It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce
application. But we=01,re here to help.

Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We=01,ll
also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security-
conscious IT manager.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to
jmeserve@nww.com.


Now on with the latest patches and alerts:


From this week=01,s Network World: A security problem has cropped up in
Foundry Networks=01, ServerIron switches that make the devices susceptible
to denial-of-service attacks.

New version of Apache Web server released

The Apache Server Project released Version 1.3.12 of the popular Apache
Web server this week. The new release fixes what Apache calls a cross-
site scripting problem that could allow malicious HTML tags to be
inserted into client-side scripts. Download the new version at:
http://www.apache.org/dist/

Problem with Linux htdig package

Both FreeBSD and Debian are reporting a problem with the htdig package
that runs on their respective platforms. The problem is with the
htsearch and could allow a user to read any file on the local machine
accessible to the user ID that the script is running under (which in
most cases is =01+nobody=01,).

nmh Linux package patched

Versions of nmh prior to 1.0.3 have a vulnerability that could allow
malicious users to modify the MIME headers in a mail message that may
cause nmh=01,s mshow command to execute arbitrary commands. A patch is
available at:
ftp://ftp.mhost.com/pub/nmh/nmh-1.0.3.tar.gz

Problem with MySQL password authentication

According to the makers of FreeBSD, a vulnerability in the MySQL
database server (prior to Version 3.22.32) could allow anyone that can
connect to the database to access it without a password. More

Louise, regarding our 2 external analysts in the Monterrey Office, which are now "Outside Contractors", and according to our previous conversation, I am sending you the numbers you asked for:

Gabriela Cantu and Alejandra Reyes, both have a Bachelors Degree in Economics from the TEC in Monterrey (Equivalent to the US MIT), with post-graduate degree in Finance. Both work for us and help us elaborating the newsletters, doing Nat Gas Market research, and helping us quote derivatives to customers, and elaborate natural gas and fuel oil presentations.

We did not hired them directly. We contracted an HR company, to which we pay a monthly charge in exchange for technical services performed by their personnel.  In principle, this scheme helped us find the right people since we could ask for a change in personel if we desired.  It also gave us other benefits like not having a head count increase at that time. We also have a signed confidentiality agreement with both of them.

Today, we pay the HR company the following, per person, in US Dollar Equivalent per month:

executed NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2
originals.  After the other party executes it, you will need to get an EBS

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of
Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory
Risk is a "legal" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies
Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in
the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes
and export - import policies.  Political Risk is a "supra-legal" action that
has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying
to put in place a "standard" process to review and analyze regualtory risk
around the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Risk
Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements of
any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3)
mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that the
most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk
event.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an
assigned person to "manage" our activities so that Enron does not face an
associated loss.

My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would
include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the
reason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals.

When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and
go through my thoughts with you.

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Enron - Dynegy Integration Team Members

As I was reading Ken Lay's announcements about Enron's merger with Dynegy, he mentioned forming an integration team.

Having twenty-three plus years of a wide range of knowledge and experience across much of Enron, I feel and believe I could be a key contributor in the integration of our two companies together.

My career with Enron has ranged from activities with many parts of our trading business, key roles in large and complex Merger and Acquisition projects, as well as working on our various pipelines.

I would like to be considered to be part of the transition team.

DEN - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards a=

ke Anderson , RB DEN - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for on=
ly 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-ya=
rd run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yar=
ds also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.=
David Patten , WR NE - The Snake Pit Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five p=
asses for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring t=
hreat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy B=
rown , WR NE - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86=
yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. =
Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams o=
n the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 1=
0/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the pas=
t, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie =
and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a F=
antasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - One Man Show Updated 10/28/01 Jone=
s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passe=
s for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones =
may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to p=
refer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red=
zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - The Guzzlers Updated 10/28/01 Centers was =
limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills id=
eally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, s=
o don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR B=
UF - ! Th! e Lie Downs Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 y=
ards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears t=
o have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasse=
lbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game a=
s a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he conti=
nued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downf=
ield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - The Nice Machine Updat=
ed 10/28/01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Consider=
ing the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked res=
pectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post g=
ood yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overa=
ll output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 10/28/01 Gad=
sden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is=
not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James =
McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/! 28! /01 McKnight caught eight p=
asses for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami r=
eceiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , R=
B NYG - The Nice Machine Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards o=
n eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbe=
rs, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , =
WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 10=
9 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player=
, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - The Execution=
ers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was=
held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but =
the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the =
ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 19=
0 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, ! no! w the =
erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce St=
aley , RB PHI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday agai=
nst Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with=
two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush de=
fense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noti=
ng that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggest=
s that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky=
starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 10! /2! 8/=
01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelph=
ia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back=
while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - The Execu=
tioners Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns an=
d no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall c=
hallenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with bette=
r stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - North Blvd Nutwhackers =
Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday =
against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot =
for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was stil=
l a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should =
break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of=
the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Meximullets Updated 10/28/01 Pittm=
an rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much =
better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will=
be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston =
, WR ARI - The Fat Bastards Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for =
108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an incons=
istent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy p=
layer because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's e=
asily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - oops, I =
did it again Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns a=
nd two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inc=
onsistent he can be. Unle! ss! the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn'=
t rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free=
Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sund=
ay, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defen=
se has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup=
, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit wil=
l give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL =
Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yard=
s, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 y=
ards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't gre=
at for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary=

So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.

After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re: unit outages.  We need to communicate with 2 different groups:  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk.  First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk.  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk.  That phone number is 916/351-2488.  When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned.

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.  Services will communicate outages to Real Time.

with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends,
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Sam indicates that FERC General Counsel viewed expediting our application poorly for fear of appearing partial.  As important, Sam indicates that Netco may need to make concessions (in what form and manner not sure) to appease staff to not hold up our application beyond 60 days.

As soon as you know the winning bidder, we will begin finalizing the FERC filing.

COLOMBIA: Colombia sets new date for key utility privatization.
12/13/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOGOTA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The embattled Colombian government on Wednesday
set a deadline of June 30 next year for its often delayed privatization of
state-run power generator ISAGEN.
The 1,636 megawatt generator, the country's third-largest and valued at about
$450 million, was most recently due to have been sold by Sept. 30 as part of
a year-old plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund to help boost
government revenues and meet tight budget targets.
But it was delayed indefinitely until just last week when the Council of
State - a tribunal set up to resolve disputes between the government and
private sector - struck down an injunction blocking the sale that was based
on a complaint from Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), Colombia's largest
public utility.
EPM has argued that it has been unfairly excluded from the bidding process
for ISAGEN by government regulators, on grounds that its ownership of the
company would violate antitrust laws by giving it a virtual monopoly over
Colombia's power generating capacity.
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos said in September that the government was
determined to finalize the ISAGEN sell-off by the end of this year, once the
Council of State ruled as expected in the government's favor.
But Santos, who spoke to reporters as he emerged from a cabinet meeting at
the presidential palace, said legal loopholes, possible changes in the
price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its
privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30.
"We have to restart this whole process. We're going to study the valuation
and reopen negotiations with possible buyers to see how we can put ISAGEN up
for sale at the best price as soon as possible," Santos said.
The sale of ISAGEN, considered one of the crown jewels in the government's
troubled privatization program, had originally been expected to take place
last December. It was later slated for the first half of 2000, at a time when
government sources said leading bidders included U.S. energy group Enron .
The sell-off in the first half of this year was delayed, until the elusive
Sept. 30 deadline, amid a flurry of attacks on the national power grid by
Marxist rebel saboteurs and legal challenges to the sale from ISAGEN's own
labor union.

2:58 (Dow Jones) As credit quality concerns dog investors, Bear Stearns'
analyst Amy Butte says in a report Wednesday that investment banks are
increasing liquidity to historically high levels, which could be a sign of
either a more conservative bent or a premonition of risk, she said. (CWM)
2:48 (Dow Jones) Gridlock may put some of Bush's measures, such as school
vouchers and Social Security privatization, on hold. But rebel Democrats may
help pass all or most of Bush's tax cuts, says economist Ian Morris at HSBC.
That wouldn't prevent hard landing in 2001, but the stimulus will be felt by
2002. By 2003, Morris says, the surplus could be more like $250 billion than
CBO's projected $400 billion. (SV)
2:39 (Dow Jones) OK, so it wasn't an unprecedented ruling that determined our
next president, but there was a big ruling in the HMO arena concerning
provider lawsuits. Chase H&Q calls judge's decision granting certain parts
and denying other parts of various defendant's motions a minor victory for
HMOs. Ruling positive for Wellpoint (WLP) and Aetna (AET), mildly positive
for Cigna (CI) and United Healthcare (UNH), mixed for PacifiCare (PHSY), and
has no impact on Humana (HUM). (TG)
2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory,
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers,
off-floor traders say. "We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than
where we are today," he said. (ZHS)
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95,
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC)
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG)
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group.
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value"
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG)
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition,
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins,
according to Lucey. (SEW)
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.:
"With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him,
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the
nation's needs." (JC)
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec.
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP)
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are "priced for perfection and expectations are
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock." Shares fell about
8.5%. (BMM)
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC)
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential
administration. "I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a
Bush cabinet," Lay said in an interview. (MPG)
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that "the main
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole." As a
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock.

2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory,
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers,
off-floor traders say. "We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than
where we are today," he said. (ZHS)
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95,
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC)
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG)
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group.
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value"
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG)
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition,
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins,
according to Lucey. (SEW)
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.:
"With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him,
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the
nation's needs." (JC)
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec.

(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are "priced for perfection and expectations are
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock." Shares fell about
8.5%. (BMM)
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC)
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential
administration. "I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a
Bush cabinet," Lay said in an interview. (MPG)
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00

So we've discussed it further, and we don't want my mistake of ordering the
cheaper Honolulu tickets to prohibit us from going to Palau to get married.

Would the cost to fly from Seattle to Palau and back be the same as flying
out of LA?  We could take the train up then from Portland to Seattle and it
would be much easier.  We are thinking two things, a) if the trip from
Seattle to Palau is about the same as the Honolulu to Palua plus the
Portland to Honolulu tickets combined, then we'll just use the tix I
already

purchased and purchase the remainder of the flight to Palau or b) if the
Seattle to Palau tix are the same price as LA to Palau then we will just
buy

those and use our Hawaii tix some other time and pay the date change price
of $90 per person.  Does that make any sense?  Either way we still want to
go to Palau to get married, and possible Yap after we review the materials
you are sending.  I know I'm taking a lot of time to make a decision, but
we

have had a bunch of changes lately in our work/life and it's been hard to
make a solid decision - until now.  So please get back to me when you can
about the tix price from Seattle, March 1st - 15th.  Thank you so much

The World Trade Center Facilities Superintendent has informed us that PGE
Underground has a main transformer with a bad network protector and is off
line.  Power needs to be off to replace this network protector.  While this
situation is inconvenient, it is an excellent opportuity to put our power
backup systems to a test under optimimal circumstances, e.g., on a Sunday.
Listed below is information about the outage.  Please review since it may
require some action on your part.

PGE must turn off its main power supply to the building from 6 - 7 a.m. and
then again from 3 - 4 p.m.
The building has a backup generator that will kick in five minutes after the
main power supply shuts off.
Enron has a UPS that will provide us with five minutes worth of power.
If everything goes well, there should be no impact.
If there are problems with the backup generator or UPS, we could experience a
power outage.
We should not experience a loss of phone service even in the unlikely event
of a power outage.
It would be prudent to take precautions if you have any systems that may be
impacted by a power outage.  You may want to log off your computer and turn
it off on Friday before you leave the office.

Someone from our local IT group will be here on Sunday in case any problems
arise.  Please contact Dave Steiner if you have any questions or concerns.

Mike Smith and Jim Steffes just phoned and indicated that the California ISO may require us to post $5MM in collateral today to cover deliveries to our California customers.  We are attempting to have them net this request with approximately $50MM of monies they owe us.  This payment will allow us to remain a scheduling coordinator for the first 5 days of December.  If we do not pay the ISO will decertify us and the utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) can immediately execute thier right to return our customers to utility service.  We have a transaction pending to sell a large portion of the contracts under the ISO that could be worth as much as $150MM. If the utilities return the customers to utility service we will not have a book to sell.

Mike or Jim, if I have missed anything or misstated anything, please reply to all.

The following message points are being circulated by Assembly Speaker Robert
Hertzberg.  These are very confidential and should not be distributed.

Deregulation has been a failure of epic proportions, and Californians are
hurting because of it.

This is bigger than politics. People have energy bills they cannot afford.
Rolling blackouts threaten our economy - as well as the safety of our people.
We cannot allow this to continue.

This is not a bailout, it's a lifeboat for consumers. We support the
Governor's plan as a framework for negotiations with the utilities.

The state purchase of transmission lines -- at the right price and under the
right terms - will restore a measure of control to a system that is out of
control.

Our goal continues to be restoring reliable, reasonably priced power to all
of California.

RE:  Notice of CFTC Approval of New COMEX Rule 4.36A and Related
Implementation of Aluminum EFS Program
____________________________________________________________________

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved new COMEX Rule 4.36A ("EXCHANGE
OF ALUMINUM FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP TRANSACTIONS").  The
new rule, which is shown below, permits the exchange of futures for swaps
("EFS") for Aluminum futures contracts.  The EFS program for Aluminum
futures has been approved on a three-year pilot basis and will go into
effect on Monday, November 27, 2000.

Under the terms of the rule, only "commercial market participants" are
eligible to enter into Aluminum EFS transactions.  In addition, a person or
entity seeking to participate in an EFS transaction must qualify as an
eligible swap participant under the terms of Part 35 of the CFTC's rules.

Until the switch of COMEX to TMS and Clearing 21 is completed, no
Exchange computer records, including clearing records, will distinguish
Aluminum EFS transactions from Aluminum EFP transactions.  The Exchange will
use an existing Exchange information slip to assist in distinguishing
Aluminum EFS transactions from Aluminum EFP transactions at the time of
execution.  This slip must be submitted to COMEX Division floor staff by the
COMEX Division Floor Member as part of the responsibility of reporting the
EFS transaction to the Exchange.  The slip will indicate that the
transaction being reported involved an exchange of Aluminum futures for
aluminum swaps.  In addition to reporting the pertinent details of the
trade, such as contract month, quantity and price, the slip will identify
the Clearing Member(s) to the transaction and will further identify the
buyer and seller in the transaction.

Brokers are further required to identify these transactions as an
"EFS" on their trading cards.  As noted, though, these transactions will be
entered into and processed in OLTE as EFPs.

The Exchange's Daily Futures Summary, which includes EFP volume and which is
provided both to the Commission and to the public, will not include a
separate column for EFS volume. Instead, a footnote on this report will
indicate that EFP volume for Aluminum contracts may also include EFS
transactions.   In addition, please be advised that COMEX Division EFP data
transmitted to market participants via the Exchange's Price Reporting System
may include data for both Aluminum EFP and Aluminum EFS transactions.

Please note that, in addition to Rule 4.36A, it is also necessary for market
participants to comply with the CFTC's EFP-related reporting and
recordkeeping regulations as if these regulations applied to EFS
transactions.  Specifically, the Exchange will require:

1) Each Exchange member, futures commission merchant
("FCM"), and introducing broker ("IB") to comply with the requirements of
Commission Regulation 1.35(a) as if this regulation applied to EFS
transactions and will further require each Exchange member, FCM, and IB to
provide the required records to the Exchange for inspection upon request;

2) Each customer to comply with the requirements of
Commission Regulation1.35(a-2)(2) as if this regulation applied to EFS
transactions and will further require each customer to provide the required
records to the Exchange for inspection upon request;

3) Each Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign
broker to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulations 17.00(a)(1)
and (2) as if these regulations applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will
further require each Exchange clearing member, FCM, and foreign broker to
file the required records with the Exchange;

4) Each trader who holds or controls a reportable
futures position to comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation
18.05 as if this regulation applied to EFS transactions, and NYMEX will
further require each trader to provide the required records to the Exchange
for inspection upon request; and

5) Upon the request of the Commission, each FCM, IB,
foreign broker, and trader to comply with the requirements of Commission
Regulations 24.03(e)(1)(iii) and (e)(2)(iv), and NYMEX will further require
each FCM, IB, foreign broker, and trader to file the required records at the
place and within the time frame specified by the Exchange.

If you have any questions concerning the operation of this program,
please contact Tom LaSala, Vice President, Compliance Department, at (212)
299-2897, or Michael Campanelli, Vice President of COMEX Floor Operations,
Floor Department, at (212) 299-2072.


Approved New COMEX RULE 4.36A
(Pilot Program)

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 4.36A. EXCHANGE OF ALUMINUM FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH,
SWAP TRANSACTIONS

(a) (1) An exchange of Aluminum futures for, or in connection with, a swap
(EFS) consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap
transaction and a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is
effected, the buyer and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the
seller and the buyer of the swap.

(2) The pilot program is available only to commercial market participants.
For purposes of this rule, a Acommercial market participant@ shall include a
person or entity that transacts business in the normal channels of commerce
in the cash commodity or related commodity underlying the EFS posted on the
Exchange and also shall include an entity that regularly maintains a book of
and acts as a dealer in swap transactions.

(b) The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the futures
contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such commodity).
The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately equivalent to the
quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap component of an EFS
transaction must comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation Part
35 (Exemption of Swap Agreements).  The initial term of the pilot program
shall be three years from the effective date of this Rule 4.36A.

(c)  (1) The report of an Aluminum EFS transaction shall be given on the
Floor of the Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) Aluminum EFS
transactions are permitted until 12:00 p.m. on the day following the last
day of trading of an expiring futures contract.

(d)  A report of such Aluminum EFS transaction shall be submitted to the
Exchange by each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such
report shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the requirements of Part 35 at the time the EFS was entered
into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the EFS has resulted or
will result in a change of payments or other such change, the kind and
quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures transaction is to be
cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and customers and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such report (form) shall be
submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon, no later than two (2)
Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the Floor of the
Exchange.

(e)  Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate Aluminum EFS transaction.  Upon the request
of the Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a
master swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.

(f)  A report of each Aluminum EFS transaction shall be given, and notice
thereof shall be posted on the Floor of the Exchange, on the day that the
transaction thereto was made, or if such agreement was made after the close
of trading, then on the next business day.  EFS transactions shall be
cleared through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures, shall be
clearly identified and marked in the same manner as EFP transactions, and
shall be recorded by the Exchange and by the Clearing Members involved.

(g)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange=s
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to this rule, shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange=s Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

I am in the middle of preparing some presentations right now, so it might be
more productive to speak by phone (503-464-8430).  Please leave your number,
if you get my voicemail.

To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS
database of plant forced and planned availability.  It seems others in
Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your
disposal.  The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR
available for free (http://www.nerc.com/~esd/).  I know Alexios in RE/EES has
this.  If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access
the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.  It
contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you
could aggregate up.

The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place
to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious
"self-reporting" error.  It is available in pdf form from the web site
http://www.wscc.com/.  Other sources that should be more near-term, but more
accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http://www.energy.ca.gov/) and the
BPA Whitebook (http://www.transmission.bpa.gov).

As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the
reported utility forecasts for loads, or you can go to fundamental data.  The
ultimate source of the census data collected by the US Dept of Commerce,
which you can buy on CDROM for cheap.  It would have this kind of information
by SIC code, by ZIP code.  You may also have access to one of the economic
forecasting businesses (Wharton's WEFA, DRI, etc.)  They have this in highly
digested and complete form.

BTW, Tim Heizenrader, who runs Fundamental Analysis and Research on the West
Desk, is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control.  Is your
client aware of this resource?

Give me a buzz and we can talk more,
Michael

Michael,

I'm an analyst in the research group. I would like your help with finding
some information specific for the West Coast. A new analyst on the West Power
desk needs information on planned outages and planned new generation. He is
studying the long-term fundamentals of electricity volatility on the West
Coastso so he also needs info on housing starts, computer sales or industrial
production figures for computer manufacturing, growth of start-up companies,
and population stats.

Any help in finding the needed info would be greatly appreciated. Contact me
or Daniel Kang (new analyst).

In a strategic move to provide relative probability to moving enovate (JV with Peoples Energy) to UBS, I believe it is critical to show Peoples our support of the office in Chicago.  The potential of this outcome increases two fold, by ensuring Gregg Penman and Richard Tomaski are employees of UBS.  Neither received an offer due to decisions made outside my control.  We have now given odds that enovate will move into Newco or be sold to a third party.  I believe this outcome is disheartening to all of us involved.  It was my goal to salvage as much of the PEC relationship as possible and meetings held in Chicago this week were essential as a first step.  I have continued to believe in this business model whether with Peoples or elsewhere and I belive strongly that Gregg and Richard are essential staff.  They "know" how to run it and none of our competitors have suceeded in this business..

My team believed in a business model and followed through in relocating their families, setting up a business with a "real" customer (that Enron all to often discounted) and created something that a significant list of third parties want to buy (BP Amoco, Oxy, Sempra, PanCanadian, El Paso, Sempra, CMS, Duke, and Dynegy).  This relationship has created over $130MM dollars of MTM for Enron without consideration of the information trading obtained.  This was not a transaction, but a business.

My recommendation for Gregg and Richard is to immediately provide an offer that requires a non-compete of 1 year with consideration of $60,000 at 6 months and $60,000 at one year, with the promise of stock in year 2.

We do not want these guys at a competitor or with Newco.  No one else in the industry has the ability to run as quickly as we will if we have this team together.  You can hold me to that.

I can be reached at home at 713/528-9854.

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a

overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to

ISDA Unveils New Margin Accord For Collateral Process
Dow Jones - May 16, 2001
By Joe Niedzielski

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association
said Wednesday that it has published new documentation on margin provisions.


The document, known as the 2001 ISDA margin provisions, updates and
simplifies ISDA'S four existing credit support documents in a single
document, ISDA said Wednesday in a press release.

"The document is easy to understand and will reduce the barriers to entry
for new derivatives market participants," Robert Pickel, ISDA's executive
director and CEO said in the release.

In many areas of the over-the-counter derivatives market, financial
institutions and other end users of derivatives , such as corporations and
fund managers, reduce credit exposure by posting cash collateral.

But unlike the highly-liquid and standardized U.S. government securities
repurchase market, where the transfer of collateral is generally initiated
by the close of business following a morning margin call, a derivatives
counterparty may have to wait as long as 10 days to two weeks before being
able to liquidate.

ISDA's new document, though, includes stepped-up timing standards for
collateral calls.

The provisions have common operational provisions, incorporate a plain
English approach and offer more streamlined timing and dispute-resolution
procedures, ISDA said.

Parties using the provisions can select jurisdiction-specific provisions to
apply to their margin arrangements under New York, English and Japanese law,
ISDA said.

The ISDA 2001 margin provisions documentation project was partially a
response to bouts of market turmoil in recent years. Several disputes have
arisen between market participants in the wake of 1998's liquidity seizure
and flight-to-quality following Russia's debt default and the near demise of
Long Term Capital Management, the heavily-leveraged hedge fund.

"The provisions were a response to market disruptions in recent years and
offer a mechanism to reduce credit exposure arising between the time of a
trade and the time at which an institution can liquidate any available
collateral," said David Maloy, managing director of global collateral and
margin at UBS Warburg and a co-chair of the ISDA collateral committee.

For institutions that want to amend their existing credit support annexes
rather than opt for the new margin provisions, amendment forms to the New
York law and English law credit support annexes will be available in June,
ISDA said.

ISDA said those forms will mirror the operative sections of the provisions
with respect to transfer timing, dispute resolution and substitutions or
exchange of margin.


IRS Officials at Hearing Question Need For Hedging Regulations Standard
BNA - May 17, 2001
By Alison Bennett

Internal Revenue Service and Treasury officials May 16 sharply questioned
witnesses on why they should broaden the risk standard used to define
hedging transactions in proposed rules (REG-107047-00) that have drawn
criticism from the practitioner community.

Nearly every hearing witness said the proposed rules do not go far enough in
implementing a new standard for hedging enacted under the Ticket to Work and
Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. No. 106-70).

That law changed the standard for qualifying hedging transactions from one
focusing on risk reduction transactions to one centered around risk
management transactions. Witnesses complained that the proposed rules (12
DTR G-10, L-25, 1/18/01) retained too great a focus on risk reduction as a
way to assess whether favorable hedging treatment should be allowed.

The rules represent "a serious and inappropriate failure" to live up to
congressional standards, said Andrea Kramer of McDermott, Will & Emery in
Chicago. "I find it inconceivable that anybody could argue that the 1999 tax
act did not result in a far-reaching and substantive change to the meaning
of hedging transactions," Kramer said.

Questions From IRS

She was questioned closely by JoLynn Ricks, an IRS attorney-adviser on
financial institutions and products, about why the government should broaden
the standard to go beyond the position taken by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board on hedging in 1998, which focused on risk reduction.

Kramer contended that Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, which was
amended last June (118 DTR G-7, 6/19/00), is not relevant to tax questions
surrounding the hedging of derivatives. "The financial accounting rules for
derivatives and hedging transactions are fundamentally different from the
tax rules," Kramer said. "I would argue that FAS 133 is not significant
here.

In addition to urging the government to replace all mention of risk
reduction in the final rules with the standard of risk management, both
Kramer and Earl Goldhammer of American Electric Power asked for favorable
treatment for certain transactions by commodities dealers.

Commodities Proposal

Under the proposal raised by both witnesses, qualifying transactions would:

* relate to a derivative valued in reference to a commodity also
handled by the dealer;
* fall within pre-approved controls on speculation set out in formally
adopted risk management policies; and

* not be identified by the commodities dealer as having been entered
into in its dealer capacity.

"We would like to know that if a trader trades within preapproved limits,
and if you have a risk management program that is not a phony program, that
that is legitimate," Goldhammer said.

Although Goldhammer was identified on an IRS hearing document as working for
America's Energy Partners (95 DTR G-2, TaxCore, 5/16/01), he told IRS
officials that is merely his company's slogan.

Salomon Smith Barney Tax Director Mark Perwien, representing the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. in New York, also
criticized the references to risk reduction found under the proposed rules.

"It's very important for a company to be able to manage its price and all of
its other risks in a way that is consistent with how it sees the
marketplace," Perwien told the government panel.

The ISDA representative acknowledged that "obviously, IRS is concerned about
being whipsawed," but said protections, such as same-day identification of
derivatives, already exist.

He stressed that, to properly implement congressional intent, the final
rules should apply to all transactions undertaken in the ordinary course of
business that alter the taxpayer's exposure to one or more of the risks
inherent in the taxpayer's core economic activities.

In addition, he said, favorable hedging treatment should be available for
weather and energy supply derivatives. IRS also should permit hedges of
dividend streams, overall profitability, and other business risks that do
not relate directly to interest rate or price changes or currency
fluctuations, Periwen told the government.

Gap Hedges Raised

Testifying on behalf of the American Council of Life Insurers, Washington,
D.C., Frank Gould of Prudential Life Insurance Co. urged IRS and Treasury to
provide favorable treatment of gap hedging of derivatives by his industry.

"IRS field agents are routinely concluding that gap hedges are not good tax
hedges--they're consistently saying they're hedges of capital assets," Gould
said.

"Gap hedging isn't about a particular asset or group of assets," he said.
"It's about maintaining balance between assets and liabilities. It's an
integral part of how we run our business."

Peter Carlisle of Baker & McKenzie, Washington, D.C., and his colleague Jeff
Wallace, both said the IRS definition of risk management is "inappropriately
restrictive."

Wallace said that, because companies approach hedging in different ways, it
would be appropriate for IRS to be more flexible in what it considers
qualifying risk management activities.

Split Approach to Hedging?

For example, he said, some companies take a "macroeconomic" approach to
hedging, in which the entire enterprise faces economic risk, while others
take a "microeconomic," or transaction-by-transaction approach to these
risks.
"Enterprise risk reduction is a nebulous concept which is really not
practicable for taxpayers who manage their risk on a microeconomic level,"
Wallace said.

Ricks asked if IRS should consider an approach which would allow taxpayers
to do both macroeconomic and microeconomic hedging, as long as they identify
which type they are doing, and allow that to control treatment of the
transaction. Both Carlisle and Wallace said they would heartily endorse such
an approach.

The government panel included two other officials from IRS financial
institutions and products, special counsel Richard Carlisle and branch chief
Alvin Kraft. Also on the panel were Viva Hammer, a Treasury
attorney-adviser, and Robert Hanson, Treasury deputy tax legislative counsel
for regulatory affairs.

The transcript of the hearing will be in BNA TaxCore.


Towards one interest rate
Business Standard - May 17, 2001
Janaki Krishnan

The introduction of options and futures to replace the time-tested badla
system effective July 2, 2001 will align interest rates in the money and
equity markets, leading to a more effective monetary transmission mechanism.
At a macro level, the significance of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (Sebi) decision to ban badla and all deferral products and have only a
cash and a derivatives market marks the integration of the equity and money
markets. This means the RBI's interest rate signals will be absorbed faster
in the wider financial system. Currently, as Shekhar Sathe, CEO of Kotak
Mahindra Mutual Fund, says, there are varying badla rates on each of the
scrips eligible for carry forward. "It is like having 200 interest rates in
the system," he says. Badla rates are derived as the sum of an equity risk
premium on that particular scrip over and above the interest rate component.
In effect, since the equity risk component varies from week to week and
differently in different scrips, it masks the cost of money. Thus, badla for
scrip X may be 30 per cent but for scrip Y it may be only 12 per cent. The
financial sector is sharply divided between the banking and the equities
sector.

All this is set to change with the introduction of derivatives.  At a
simplified level, since operators can take a position on the spot and
futures markets at the same time, the cost of money is already factored into
the derivative prices. This reflects the opportunity cost of taking a
forward position. Thus, an operator who buys in spot and short sells in the
futures market is actually putting up cash now in return for future gains.
Since this involves a cash outlay, the operator will at least expect his
returns to cover the interest costs for the period of the contract.
Derivatives pricing, thus, incorporates the cost of money. Says Sebi board
member J R Varma, "The system will eventually lead to a convergence of
interest rates throughout the system." Market sources said though the extent
of banks' involvement in the revised trading systems will only be clarified
later, there were tremendous opportunities for banks to take proprietary
positions in the derivative markets. For instance, banks could play a
leading role in the developments of "calendar spreads" which are basically
forward-to-forward contracts in the foreign exchange markets. Thus, a bank
may buy a one-month contract and sell a six-month contract. Since the price
of the latter will be more than that of the one-month contract, the bank
will make a net spread. But since the market rates of interest will smoothen
out over all markets, this spread will typically reflect the difference
between one-month and six-month money. "Arbitrage opportunities like this
will lead to a uniformity of interest rates," Varma said. Money market
dealers welcomed the move saying that "equities as an asset class are a
welcome addition to the limited deployment options before banks".
Acknowledging that not all banks will be comfortable with dealing in the
equity derivatives markets, one dealer says, "As long as one bank is
comfortable arbitraging between the money and equity markets, the rates will
align as this bank can borrow in call and deploy the funds in derivative
spreads. If the call money rates are higher, this bank can do a reverse
arbitrage." The second implication is that equity prices in the spot markets
will respond quicker to interest rate changes. Currently, lower interest
rates will to lower interest costs for companies in the coming years,
thereby boosting its net profits. This reflects in optimism on the equity
price front after interest rates are cut. But with a derivatives market, a
rate cut will immediately impact derivative prices and arbitrageurs will
ensure that this is immediately transmitted to spot equity prices too. "Much
like in the US, we are looking at a situation where money market rates will
determine the valuations of a wide spectrum of asset classes, and not just
gilts," the chief dealer, of a private bank says. "This will lead to a much
more responsive financial system," he adds.


Credit protection costs down after Fed cut.
Reuters - May 17, 2001
By Tom Burroughes

LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - The cost of credit protection declined across
most sectors in the default swap market on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal
Reserve's rate cut but prices on two firms' debt rose due to planned new
issuance, dealers said.

Credit default swaps narrowed around two to three basis points for
automakers and telecoms, continuing a trend of recent weeks and further
encouraged by the Fed's 50-basis point easing on Tuesday, said a dealer for
a European bank in London.

Default swaps are insurance type instruments, which allow investors to
adjust their exposure to the risk of default or other event on a bond or
loan. They compose the most liquid part of the present credit derivative
market.

"Spreads in the cash and default (swap) market are both two to three basis
points tighter in general," the dealer said.

In telecoms, five-year default swaps on British Telecom were cited at 85/90,
about two basis points tighter, Deutsche Telekom were two basis points in at
98/108, and France Telecom slightly narrower at 87/97, the dealer said.

In the car sector, the dealer said protection on DaimlerChrysler has fallen
about two basis points to 87/91. Another trader at a European bank said
French carmaker Peugeot traded at 21, three bps down from the start of the
week. In banks, activity was quiet but default swaps were a touch tighter.
Deutsche Bank senior debt was cited at a bid/offer spread of 14/19.

In industrials, default swaps inched down on firms such as French glassmaker
St Gobain , which declined to a bid/offer spread of 37/43, down around four
basis points from Monday, a dealer said.

DEFYING THE TREND

Credit protection costs rose on a couple of firms to buck the general trend.
Five-year default swaps on the Swedish mobile phone company Ericsson rose 15
basis points to 115/135 from Tuesday, when bankers announced the firm was to
issue 1.25 billion euros of five-year and 250 million sterling of seven-year
bonds.

Another Scandanavian firm in play was the Finnish-Swedish forest industry
group Stora Enso , which is to issue a dollar-denominated global bond.

Five-year default swaps have widened about 10 basis points to 70/85 since
the announcement last week, said a dealer for a European bank.

MOSTLY ONE WAY

Default swaps were grinding lower on most names, in part because of
synthetic credit portfolio deals which means players who are short credit
risk are hedging their positions by selling default swaps.

The growth of the synthetic portfolio market has been pressing down credit
protection prices recently. A synthetic portfolio replicates portfolios of
bonds by selling default swaps on various names.

To change this trend players may need to believe the interest rate outlook
is changing or fresh debt supply is in the pipeline, said one dealer for a
European bank in London. "We need some issuance and a view that rates have
bottomed out," he said.


Argentine bond swap seeks to calm fears of debt default
Financial Times - May 17, 2001
By Peter Hudson & Thomas Catan

David Mulford, the US banker who has played a leading role in putting
together Argentina's massive bond swap, on Wednesday defended the deal,
saying it represented a new market-led approach to tackling sovereign debt
crises.

The deal, which seeks to exchange near-term bonds for longer dated paper, is
seen as crucial to calming fears that Argentina could default on its $128bn
debt.

Investors are anxiously awaiting terms of the transaction, which Mr Mulford,
a former US Treasury undersecretary with connections to Domingo Cavallo,
Argentine economy minister, said could be launched as early as next week.

Speaking in Buenos Aires on Wednesday, Mr Mulford, international chairman at
Credit Suisse First Boston, said the deal would be easily the largest of its
kind and could resolve Argentina's financing problems without the need for
additional aid from financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund
helped assemble a package of aid worth nearly $40bn in December.

Although he declined to discuss details of the swap, citing Securities and
Exchange Commission regulations, Mr Mulford described it as "essential to
long-term success in restoring Argentine growth".

He added that the operation would imply a "substantial reduction" in debt
payments over the next three to four years. If the deal was a success, he
said, its size "will effectively change the Argentine debt market and market
perception".

According to bankers, the transaction could save Argentina $3bn-$4bn in debt
servicing costs before 2006, giving it time to resume growth and bring its
debt burden under control.

Argentina's benchmark FRB bond surged 2l points on Wednesday after the
Argentine president, Fernando de la Rua, signed a decree authorising the
deal.

Argentina has been mired in recession for nearly three years, raising doubts
about its ability to keep servicing foreign debt. That prospect has caused
alarm because the country accounts for almost a quarter of tradeable
emerging market debt.

Although the overall size of the debt is comparable to that of other
emerging markets, Mr Mulford said concerns about its short-term structure
meant that "unless that is addressed it is doubtful world markets will
really support growth" in Argentina.

The country's interest rates are at a very high level as a result of
investor uncertainty. But Mr Mulford rejected suggestions that Argentina
should await lower rates before launching the deal. "It's essential to do
this deal now," he said.

participants attend at least the first 30 minutes of a briefing to be
introduced and to also hear the visitor's overview and it's relationship
building.

Second
GDF will be in the U.S. for one week touring the following companies in the
gas industry:

East & West Team
Monday  May 1  Enron    Houston
Tuesday  May 2  El Paso Energy  Houston
Reliant   Houston
West Team:
Wednesday May 3  PG&E     San Fran

Friday  May 5  Con Ed   New York
PSE&G   New Jersey

Third:
The presentation will be projected off an LCD projector.   I will supply a
wireless mouse and "laser" pointer for your use if you wish to use them.
GDF attendees will receive a Welcome Package to include a color bound copy of
the presentation, Note pad, Enron Profile and Enron Annual Report.

Lastly:
Restatement of Briefing Objectives and Theme

Purpose of the Visit:
For Gaz de France -
To develop some insight in to what a competitive market place may mean for
their domestic operations.  They want to learn from Enron's gas deregulation
experiences.

For Enron -
Educate them on Enron's gas deregulation experiences and the outcome of the
U.S. gas pipeline restructuring.
Help them to understand why they should embrace open access in order to help
speed up open access in France.

Enron Messages:
Overall Message:
Incumbent utilities with the right (progressive) approach can not only
survive but thrive under an open access regime.  The way to win is not by
dragging your feet and trying to protect historical markets but embracing the
change.
Prior to open access
Emphasis on how bad things were prior to open access (the market moved from
surplus to shortage/major commodity price swings and exposure to price risk)
After open access
Enron (even our regulated businesses) grew dramatically because the company
embraced open access (throughput increased 40 to 50% w/o pipeline expansion)
Enron treated the transport business like a business, viewing producers and
marketers as customers.

We do not have any information yet from our management so I can't tell you any more about the structure of the company.  Hopefully I'll know more by Tuesday.  Let me know what time on Tuesday. Maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 3:00 right now and you are out that way and Cindy has to go that way.

We have been served with the data responses of Northern Border to requests by
PAGUS, NGPL, Staff, and others.  Some of this information would be useful to
John in preparing for his testimony at the hearing, and also for the purpose
of crafting the cross examination of opposing witnesses.  These data
responses are available in our office for you to peruse it at your leisure.

In terms of scheduling, the next important date is June 14, which is when
Northern Border submits rebuttal testimony, and when Staff, PAGUS, and NGPL
file rebuttal in response to John's answering testimony.  Discovery on that
testimony is due June 23.  Your help in formulating discovery will be needed.

The hearing is presently scheduled for July 18 (absent settlement).
Obviously we will need to get together to prepare cross of the opposing
witnesses and to prep John for his testimony.

In terms of progress on settlement, you should be aware that while there have
been some private settlement talks among certain parties, there is no
presently scheduled settlement conference.  Nevertheless, we expect some or
all of the parties will be working to try to achieve some form of settlement
until the hearing starts.  However, whether a full or partial settlement of
the rate case issues will occur before the hearing is too speculative to
predict at this time.

Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The focus of attention for the markets this week will be tomorrow's meeting
by the Federal Reserve. According to Lehman Brothers' economists, the
downward revision to second quarter GDP growth into negative territory will
be disturbing to the Fed, as will the sharp drop in the Philadelphia Fed
index in July and the continuing deterioration in stock prices. However, the
markets are seeing evidence that the inventory correction process is coming
to an end. Against this background, they expect the Fed to cut the funds
rate another 25 basis point, to 3.5%.

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.48%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.93%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.49%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.52 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.37 p/mcf.

AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

CIENA Corp(CIEN) 3 - Market Perform S. Levy, .212.526.2499
A Fall From Grace (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.78 EPS 2000 N/A $0.33 N/A N/A

Mkt Cap: $9.7B EPS 2002 $1.00E $0.50E $0.99E 57.6
FY: 10/31 Price Target $50 N/A
Rank 1 3
*We are now officially downgrading our rating on CIEN shares to 3-Market
Perform from 1-Strong Buy because even after a
precipitous decline in the share price we do not see the shares providing
any reasonable return for at least the next six months and
believe further downside is possible.
*Assuming CIENA's long-haul DWDM sales decline 20% YoY in FY02, we
anticipate FY02 total sales of $1.80 bil, up 12% YoY vs.
$2.44 bil and 40% YoY gr previously. This translates to CY01 and CY02 sales
of $1.66B and $1.935B (+16%) vs. $1.92B and
$2.65B (+38%) previously.
*We now est FY02 EPS falling to $0.50 from $0.61 in FY01 versus our previous
est of $0.74 and $1.00. This translates to new CY01
and CY02 EPS estimates of $0.52 and $0.59 (+13% YoY) vs $0.77 and $1.10
(+43% YoY) in our previous model.
*In our view, overall potential upside to our current sales forecasts is at
least equally matched by the overall potential downside from
current levels.

FOCUS STOCKS

Specialty Chemicals T. Gerdeman, .312.609.4031
Which Chemical Co.'s Benefit From A Weak U.S. Dollar?
*Given the declining U.S. dollar vs. major foreign currencies, it is
worthwhile to review the geographical sales composition of our
U.S. specialty chemical co.'s. The U.S. dollar has been particularly weak
vis-a-vis the Euro, hence we place disproportionate
weighting on the European component of each respective co.'s sales. Select
co.'s hedge their currency exposure, others have dollar-denominated
int'l. sales, hence it is impossible for us to estimate the exact benefit
for a given co. Directionally, however, we clearly
can develop a sense for the biggest beneficiaries.
*Co.'s possessing the greatest % of sales from Europe, in descending order,
include: OMG, SIAL, CBM, and EC. A weaker dollar
could make them more cost-competitive, boosting sales and EPS.

*Following a meeting with the Chief Credit Officer, we remain cautious
regarding the near and intermediate term credit outlook at
UB.
*We believe there will be further credit issues tied to the $1.4B of
non-relationship syndicated exposure and $1.3B communications

*As most past credit problems were centered in the non-relationship
syndicated, not the broader corporate portfolio, we question
whether the reorientation toward greater consumer exposure, in large part on
a wholesale basis, will add value.
*Due to the market action in the stock and results of our DCF analysis, we
are refining our target price to $36 from $30.

appears to be progressing according to schedule with
management noting (1) comfort with near-term EPS expectations and (2) a
continued belief that WMI, over time, will be successful
in driving margins into line with that of its peers.
*Multiple cost reduction & price based initiatives appear to be on track to

Rank 1 1
*We continue to recommend purchase of shares of Cardinal, after its
analyst/investor meeting held last Thursday, August 16, and
provide some observations & perspectives.
*Key observations - 1) company did a very good job of building a bottoms-up
model as to how it gets to its top-line (and operating
profit) guidance, by division, in our view. 2) Company's tax rate will
continue to be a positive lever to EPS this year, though an
additional 40-50 basis point reduction, and could also see some further
reduction in FY03.
*In addition, 3) company's CFFO guidance of $800-$900mm could once again
turn out to be nicely conservative, in our view. 4) leads
to company's view of EPS visibilty being "extremely high".
*We would also note, of keen importance, implementation of FAS142 provides
"new world" of acquistion flexibility for CAH, leading
to good possibility of action over next 1-5 months, in our view. Confirm $83
target for well-positioned co., rep. 29x our current C02
cash earnings of $2.85.

FY: 8/31 Price Target $40 $30
Rank 2 2
*On Wednesday 8/15 of last week we commented on a mid day break-in that
recent checks indicated business at some of our EMS
providers could remain flattish for the remainder of this year, and into
next, and highlighted Jabil as one of these providers.
*After further review we are going to lower our FY02 estimates for Jabil due
to our checks and very slow end market demand. While
we believe Jabil is benefiting from some industry consolidation wins, and
the Marconi ramp, some business is moving away from the
company to lower cost suppliers.
*For FY02 our revenue est moves to $4.5B, up 3% y/y but down from our prior
$5B est, and for EPS to $0.72 vs our prior $0.94. Our
CY02 estimate goes to $0.82 down from $1.09. Our new price target is $30,
down from $40. We retain our 2-Buy rating.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $45 $45
Rank 1 1
*Fleming remains, in our opinion, an extremely well-run company with strong
growth prospects, and we believe last weeks drop in
price represents an extraordinary good buying opportunity. Fleming is
currently trading at a 2002 P/E of 11.1 x on our estimate of
$2.55, down from 14.4 x two weeks ago. We re-iterate our 1-Strong Buy
rating, and our $45 price target, and we are maintaining our
FY01 EPS estimates at $1.96 and our FY02 EPS at $2.55.
*On Friday, Fleming announced that it has reached an agreement to settle the
largest of its remaining old lawsuits. We see this as a
positive, and we think the market will agree, once it understands that the
details of the settlement.
*Recent conversations with FLM management indicate that most of the glitches
related to Kmart are being resolved smoothly and that
nothing unusual has occurred given the magnitude of the transition. We
continue to many growth opportunities with non-traditional
customers, and we expect the company to be more aggressive about going after
these opportunities now that Kmart is progressing
smoothly.

Ric--

I am writing to confirm our discussion of yesterday afternoon.  After we
spoke, I conferred with John Watson who, like me, believed that we were
going to use terms of the Enron Field financing for the Arena, with a few
minor changes that we had discussed.  The term sheet that we originally
provided you during the summer reflected that arrangement.  We have
discussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,
and they have approved the garage loan on those terms.

John and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James
Hernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a
significant departure from the Enron Field deal.  Although we understand the
arguments each of you have made in favor of such comments, these comments
nonetheless will need to be evaluated by a business representative from the
partnership and approved by the partnership.  I recommend that we schedule a
meeting next week so that we can discuss these issues and try to resolve
them.

Finally, John was disappointed to hear that the HCHSA will be unwilling to
prepay the $1.4 million amount needed by the referendum.  Because we
understand that the referendum campaign is in dire need of funding, we hope
that you might reconsider your decision not to prepay the $1.4 million until
after we have finalized the term sheet.

I will be unavailable for a great deal of the day today, but I will have
time to meet next week.  Please let me know when we might be able to get
together to discuss the term sheet.

Ben, Harry Kingerski shared with me your message to Rick Shapiro relative to
your need for regulatory assistance on projects located in various
jurisdictions.
I have been assisting other ENA people on similar issues and now offer to
assume responsibility for putting together a matrix of the various rules that
apply to your projects.  The primary issues that I see are as follows:

(1) whether new generation projects require a certificate of need or similar
grant of authority from state authorities, and if so, what is entailed in
obtaining  such authority ;

(2) the degree to which, if any, the owners of such projects fall within the
regulatory jurisdiction of state PUCs (as a public utility or otherwise);

(3) whether there are state siting requirements (and if so, what are they);
and

(4) an assessment of local zoning requirements.

Obviously, there may also be environmental permitting issues as well - is
that something you are looking for a state-by-state assessment of as well?

I will send to you a memo that was prepared recently for ENA/Pulp & Paper
relative to a small generation project in Wisconsin.  The purpose of sending
you the memo is to determine whether the issues analyzed in that context are
similar to those you are confronting.  I will need more information about the
projects to get started.  Please call me when you have a chance to discuss
this matter.  -Bob (3-3180)

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

products.  I would revise the process described below to place the
responsibility on each legal group to review counterparties based upon
products (US vs. European).  Accordingly, I will review a list of current
European counterparties and all new European counterparties to determine if
they have the necessary authority to U.S. power and leave it to the UK legal
group to review the list of US counterparties to determine if such
counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products.  Thus,
the process would be as follows:

1) Each legal group (NA and UK) defines the rules which are applied to
restrict companies for trading (e.g. Must have a Power license to trade
Power) for its group of products
2) Each legal group applies its own rules to all counterparties (NA and UK)

If you will send me a list of all preapproved European counterparties and
ensure that I receive copies of all new European counterparty lists, I will
begin implementing this process.

This proposed process is subject to feedback from Edmund and Justin.

Gawd Boy - you have more questions for me...does this mean you do not require my assistance with CA Block Forwards?  Since you NEVER returned my phone calls??  What's the poop scoop on Jeff S?
Dennis left the NW about a year ago and went to Louisiana I think. Somewhere down around your parts.
Hey, is that Steve guy - can't remember his last name - still working in Fundies?  He worked with Jim B. in Structuring before they got uppity and went to Broadband. Then Steve came back and Jim went to Houston - THAT Steve.  What's his last name and is he still there?

The current schedule contemplates sending a draft of the Disclosure Schedules
to Skadden by the end of the day on Friday.  Please provide any remaining
comments to the draft Schedules as soon as you can.  I realize there will
still be some holes, as we continue to negotiate the Purchase and Sale
Agreement.  No doubt it would help to have the Appendices to the Purchase and
Sale Agreement completed, or say maybe a dollar amount or two completed in
the Definitions section.  Thanks for all the help.  Lance.

I forgot to email myself the brief to track changes, but here are my changes
in writing:

p. 1:  Para starting "focusing on the latter," that sentence, change "get
creative" to be innavotaive in its approach."

p. 2:  1st full Paragraph, Second sentence, change "uniting" to "common" and
there is a typo on line5, reduction n consumption.   Should be "of"

page 6:  We need the RR for PG&E.

Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal,
unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period.  We
told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times
in the brief.

We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices,
as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed.

page 8:  2.  Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete "between"
in first sentence.

page 9:  Second full paragraph, begining "Again, the UDS's, "  Second
sentence, sited should be "cited"

p. 12:  First full paragraph beginning "A primary component,"  Insert a
sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of
proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak.

Second full parag, beginning, "Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about
arbitrariness in there too.  And change "more necessary goal" in 4th sentence
to "more critical goal"

I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott,
so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to.

I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check
email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in
Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the
9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).  But I will communicate with
Harry and everyone else before then.  Thanks.

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

Yes, silly me.  But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight
back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day
of his flight.

It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.  I assume you're still
at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.

Hi, hope you are well.
?
I'm just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people
attending the energy and weather course.? Our records show that it hasn't
been paid, which is good.? We will re-do the invoice and charge you only  for
Alex and Tom's attendance since Paulo didn't show.? Is this OK with  you?? By
the way, we only charged $250 a person for the weather course  since it was
suppose to be an exchange of information session, and Enron Weather  paid for
the venue.
?
Nice to have finally met you in Houston!

This is just a reminder about the "care package" of Enron cases and

All,

I will be giving a 40min presentation on the above topic at the EPRM Energy
2000 conference in April. The bulletpoints are:

Balancing market risk and credit risk to achieve a reliable estimation of
total risk
Incorporating market risk into a credit risk model
Calculating probability of default using credit risk and market risk
Refining business practice to reflect credit risk and market risk evaluations

My proposed approach is to quickly step through the practical process of
modelling credit risk, resulting in measures for expected loss and
credit-VAR; then show how default probs can be calculated using bond and
equity data. Finally I'll describe how credit risk can be mitigated using
credit derivatives - plugging EnronCredit.com of course.

Any other ideas for broad topics and/or specific points to mention will be
appreciated. The presentation has to be submitted next week.

Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.  I really do wish
Houston were at least an hour closer.

Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.  I wish
Karin had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.  I really
appreciate all your work.

Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:  Putin, the new Russian
president, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, " George W.
Bush wants to know if you're related to Ras Putin."

Darrell and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very well
and doubled back before reaching the bridge.  I think I was all tuckered out
from our Sun. walk.

The 3 of us were trying to get together for Darrell's birthday lunch, so I'm
going to make lunch here on Sat.  Cathy is coming into town for a haircut and
K&J&G will be here since Karin has an appt. as well.  We usually go out to
lunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!

I'm cleaning up the house from the weekend today.  Hope you have a good week.
love, mum

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

This is good information.  One other thing that wasn't mentioned was the fact that all of the partnership documents are in the name of LRCI (and other wholly owned affiliates of ENA - but not ENA itself), while the storage and transport agreement is in the name of ENA [Gerald - I think this is right].  My guess is that this may further strengthen Mark's belief that the arrangements should not be linked.

Based on Mark's conclusion - I would like to get together internally to figure out what should be done on the storage and transport agreement.  It might be in the best interest of the creditors to give Bridgeline a sense that we might be rejecting the agreement so that they can line something else up (thereby mitigating the harm to the partnership and indirectly to ENA as a 40% interest owner).

I have been soooo busy lately and I'm starting to feel like I sold my soul to

I've been discussing some of the Back Web issues with Mike Harris from EES.
I don't think the IBM proprietary software will be an issue, but we still
have to sort out conflicts with TIBCO -- which appears to be quite a popular
tool at Enron.

Now that I have analyzed this project with my IT hat on, I would like to
suggest that we enlist the services of a business analyst from Enron Net
Works.  We do have a technical team (2 members) from ENW, but they are
focused on the architecture and design of the system and might inadvertantly
miss some of the user-specific issues involved with a roll-out of this
magnitude.   ENW will have ultimate responsiblity for deploying BackWeb and
it would be in their best interests to assign a business analyst at the front
end.  In fact, it is probably appropriate to have a business analyst from EES
and one from ETS working on this team, as well.  We have to keep field
personnel in mind with a project of this scope, and the business units will
understand the unique issues of their own users much better than we at Corp
could hope to do.  The Windows 2000 teams at each business unit would
probably have the most suitable people to commit to this project, as they
have so recently undertaken a similar deployment.

I want to be sure we are including everyone who should be involved.  Courtney
and I can certainly speak to the requirements for Corp, but I don't want to
presume to speak for EES or ETS.

Does this sound reasonable to you?  If so, I will contact the appropriate
people at ENW, EES and ETS to find a business analyst from each group.

MArk--I put out a couple of calls to find on the 2002 Governors race in Wyoming, and the feedback I got was similiar to what we talked about.....there has not been a clear candidate yet, and Joe Meyers name is one of three possible Republican contestants. (the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run.

How are you?  Are you working hard?  Hopefully, this email has my name
on it!  I haven't received an email from Jeff yet, but I hope he can
help me out.

I had a terrible night's sleep last night.  All I could think about is
how much I have to do and how little money I have.  I kept dreaming
about not getting things done fast enough.  It rained all night too.
The  thunder was so loud that it woke me up when I finally fell asleep.

Anyway, I'm gonna be ecstatic when this week is over!!!  It's going to
be so nice to relax with you.  All I have is one final to study
for...yeah, it's worth 30% but it's only one final!

If I have a chance I'll email you again later (esp. since I can't call
you this week).

5 more days of class.......

EMAILTEXT:
The reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas
under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or
periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar
quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned
maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that
gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.

Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm
not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as
the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not
completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the
tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either
party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court
or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if
we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety
rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure
notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but
simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner,
the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction
provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under
ordinary contract law.

I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is
going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed
itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers
reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate
plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.

_____________________________________________________________________

The stock market closed mixed today. June Nasdaq prices are still
within striking distance of the April high of 1995. Sideways trading
the past week has negated a fledgling four-week-old uptrend on the
daily bar chart. Bulls still have some heavy lifting to do and their
next upside objective is resistance at the key 2,000 area. First
support is seen at the 1,732 area. June S&P 500 futures closed firmer
today. Prices have leveled off the past week, after rallying solidly
off the early-April low. Technically, bulls still need to push prices
above the 1285 resistance area. My bias is still that any recovery in
the stock market and the stock indexes won't be dramatic, but a
slower grind higher, with fits and starts. First resistance is seen
at 1285.00. First support is seen at 1206.00.

LIVESTOCK: June live cattle closed 2 cents higher at 71.12. Prices
closed at the session low and managed to fill an upside gap on the
daily bar chart that was created in early trading. The market saw
another upside corrective bounce earlier today, after punching to a
fresh 6.5-month low last Friday. The bears are in control of the
market. Prices are still trading below an accelerating two-month-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart. The market is still a bit
short-term oversold, and I would not be surprised to see more of an
upside correction this week. Next support, basis June, is seen at
$71.00. First resistance now comes in at the $72.00 level.

August feeder cattle closed up 3 cents today at $88.25. Prices closed
at the session low today. Range-bound trade continues. As this market
neared the bottom end of the recent trading range, which is around
$87.50, the market again took an upside bias. Look for more choppy
trading between $89 and $87.50. If prices can break out of that
aforementioned range, the direction of the breakout will likely be
the direction of the next significant trend. Next resistance is seen
at $88.70-- today's high. First support is seen at $88.00.

June lean hogs closed $0.15 higher today, at $67.50. Prices are still
showing consolidation at lower levels, after the sell off last week.
Hogs are still a bit overdone on the downside, on a short-term basis,
so some more corrective upside consolidation would not surprise me.
Still, the bears have the strong momentum on their side at present.
Next support lies at $66.25. First resistance is located at the 68.15
level--today's high.

GRAINS: July corn futures closed off 3 cents at $2.05 today. Crop
progress reports out Monday evening showing very good planting
progress in the U.S. weighed on the corn market today. There is just
not much bullish fundamental news in the corn market right now. The
weak wheat market is also weighing on corn. On Monday, respected Iowa
State University Climatologist Elwynn Taylor predicted record yields
for the Corn Belt this year. It would not surprise me to see the
commodity funds make another significant downside assault on the corn
and bean markets in the near term. Next support is now seen at $2.00.
Next resistance is seen at the $2.07 1/2 level--today's high.

July soybeans closed 2 3/4 cents higher at $4.40 1/2 today. Prices
are consolidating the recent gains, but bulls still by no means have
any significant momentum. Fundamentally, there is not much in the way
of good news for bulls right now. I would not be surprised to see the
commodity funds make another downside push in beans in the near term.
This market is still in technical trouble and it's going to take a
significant weather scare this spring or summer to force prices
solidly higher. First resistance is seen at the $4.45 area and then
$4.50. First support is seen at $4.35 and then at $4.30.

July soybean meal closed off $1.10 at $155.70 today. Prices this week
are showing a corrective pullback after they pushed to a fresh
eight-week high last Friday. Recent price action is still encouraging
to the bulls and is a sign the lows are in place in the meal market.
Next resistance comes in at the $158.50 area. First support is seen
at $154.00.

July bean oil closed 22 points higher at 15.09 cents today. Prices
saw a corrective bounce today after dropping to a new contract low of
14.76 cents on Monday. This market is technically much weaker than
beans or meal, and is still a bit overdone on the downside, on a
short-term basis. I would be surprised if there is much downside left
in oil. Next resistance comes in at 15.25 cents. Next support is seen
at the contract low of 14.76 cents.

July Chicago wheat closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $2.66 3/4 today.
Prices poked to a new contract low of $2.65. More rain in the Plains
has cast a bearish pall over the market. With the wheat crop behind
schedule anyway, the recent rains could allow the crop to make some
good improvement. Bears are in full command. Just last week, prices
pushed to a fresh six-week high. Serious technical damage has
occurred the past few sessions. First support lies at the contract
low of $2.65. Next resistance is seen at $2.70. This market is
short-term oversold and I suspect we'll see a corrective bounce soon.

SOFTS: July N.Y. sugar closed 18 points higher at 9.10 cents today.
We could see a bull flag starting to form in sugar, on the daily bar
chart. This many times occurs as prices consolidate steep gains. A
three-month high was scored in July sugar late last week. The bulls
have good momentum and a steep and accelerating five-week-old uptrend
line is still in place on the daily bar chart. Next resistance now
comes in at 9.25 cents. First support is now seen at 8.80 cents.

July N.Y. coffee closed 15 points higher at 68.90 cents today. Prices
pushed to another fresh two-month high today as the bulls continue to
gain momentum. This recent move is the most significant showing by
the bulls since mid-January. The fact that prices have not sold off
sharply the past three sessions is encouraging for the bulls,
too--given recent price history. Still, the bears could be setting a
trap, like they did in early January. If bulls can push prices above
70 cents and then see follow-through strength, bears will begin to
think this uptrend is sustainable. First resistance comes in at 70
cents. First support is seen 65.00 cents.

July N.Y. cocoa closed $55 higher today, at $1,044. Today's strong
gap-higher trade on the daily bar chart put the bulls back on a level
playing field with the bears in a hurry. Prices pushed above and
negated a 2.5-month-old downtrend line on the daily bar chart. Next
resistance comes in at $1,050 and then $1,060. First support is now
seen at today's low of $1,001.

July cotton closed 99 points lower at 45.44 cents today. Cotton is in
a strong bear market, and a new contract low was scored just today,
at 45.40 cents. Right now, any rebounds are likely to be just selling
opportunities for the bears. But, my bias is still that we are not
that far from a bottoming process. Next support lies at 45.00 cents.
First resistance is seen around 48.00 cents. Would-be bottom-pickers
should beware. Bulls need to watch for some "basing" action, which
may be beginning.

July orange juice futures closed 45 points lower today, at 76.95
cents. Prices late last week probed into an important gap area on the
daily bar chart, which begins at 77.85 cents, but did not fill that
gap on the upside. Bears rule and the market is still technically
weak. However, if the aforementioned gap can be filled on the upside,
that's an important first step for the bulls in turning the market
around. That gap will be filled if prices move above 78.55 cents,
which is first resistance. Next support comes in at 76.00 cents.

July lumber futures closed $2.60 lower at $308.40 today. Prices just
Monday hit yet a new for-the-move high, at $313.20, as the bull
market roars on. Today's price action is just some healthy
consolidation in a bull market. Expect more volatility, however, as
is typical for this market. The next upside objective for the bulls
is the $315.00 area. First support is seen at the $300.00 area. This
market is still short-term overbought, technically, and I would not
be surprised to see a decent downside correction soon.

METALS: June COMEX gold closed down $1.00 today, at $265.50. Prices
late last week pushed to a new seven-week high. Despite recent choppy
trading, this market is still trending up from its early-April low.
But bulls need to see some solid upside movement soon to keep what
momentum they have recently gained. But the fact that prices have not
sold way off after the rally is encouraging to the bulls. Next
resistance is located at $268. First support is seen at $264.00.

July silver closed up $0.008 today, at $4.335 an ounce. Prices are
not that far above the contract low. Still, prices are chopping at
lower levels. This suggests a "basing" action that many markets need
to change the trend from down, to sideways, to eventually up. Next
support is seen at $4.30. First resistance is seen at $4.41. Bears
still have the advantage.

July N.Y. copper closed 1.80 cents lower today, at 76.85 cents. Stock
market weakness helped drive this market lower today. Prices are
still attempting to build a base and recover from the early-April
low. My bias is still that the downside is limited for copper. The
stock market and the U.S. economy will have to be healthy before the
bulls can really get something going in copper, however. Next
resistance is seen at 78.00 cents. Next support is seen at 76.00
cents.

ENERGIES: July crude closed $0.19 lower at $28.35 today. Bulls and
bears are at a stand-off and will duke it out over the near term.
Expect more choppy trading. Next support is seen at 28.00. Next
resistance lies at $29.50.

July heating oil closed 30 points higher today, at .7551. Bulls still
have the slight edge, but look for more choppy trading in the near
future. Next support is seen at 73.00 cents. Next resistance is seen
at 77.50 cents.

July unleaded gasoline closed 128 points lower at .9898 today. Prices
scored a new contract high just Monday, and saw follow-through
selling today. That confirms a key reversal in this market. But given
the recent volatility in unleaded, I am not placing a lot of emphasis
on this key reversal. Bulls are still in command as peak driving
season nears. Top-pickers beware! Next resistance is seen at $1.03.
First support is seen at $.9600.

July natural gas closed 3.6 cents higher at $4.35 today. Today was
just an upside correction in a steep downtrend. Prices hit a fresh
five-and-one-half-month low Monday. Next support is seen at $4.25 and
first resistance is now at $4.50. This market is still short-term
oversold, technically.

FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The June Euro currency closed 62 points lower
at .8828 today. Bears have the decided edge again as bulls have lost
all the momentum they had gained in mid-April. My bias is still that
there is not much downside left in the Euro. Look for more choppy
action in the near term. Bulls will again gain good momentum if they
can push prices above the .9075 area. Next support is now seen at
.8800. Next resistance is seen at .9000.

The June Japanese yen closed 5 points lower at .8279 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh six-week high last Friday, but bears are still in
control. Bulls are hoping for some "basing" activity at lower levels,
and that may be occurring, although it's too early to tell. Next
support now lies at the .8100 level. First resistance is seen at the
.8326 level.

The June Swiss franc closed 36 points lower today, at .5739. Bears
are in command. Still, my bias is that prices won't deteriorate much
more. Next support is seen at the .5700 level. First resistance comes
in at the .5830 level.

The June Australian dollar futures closed 37 points lower at .5150
today. Prices pushed to a fresh two-month high late last week and are
consolidating a bit this week. The bulls still have the advantage as
a five-week-old uptrend line is in place on the daily bar chart. My
bias is that the lows are in place. First resistance is now seen at
.5250. First support is now seen at .5100.

The June Canadian dollar closed 14 points lower today, at .6464.
Prices sold off some more today after the key reversal down on the
daily bar chart that was scored Monday. Bulls had good momentum, but
have lost some the past two sessions. The key reversal does not
indicate prices are headed back toward the lows seen a few weeks ago.
What it does suggest is a decent downside correction to the recent
gains will occur over the near term. This currency had been near
recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more downside.
Next resistance is seen at the .6548 level. First support is seen at
the .6450 level.

The June British pound closed 126 points lower at 1.4244. Trading
continues choppy at lower levels. This currency was not that far
above recent historic lows and I do not think there is much more
downside in the sterling. One could argue that price action the past
few weeks has been a "basing" before prices eventually turn north. A
move above the 1.4500 level would be considered a bullish "upside
breakout" from the recent congestion area. Next support is now seen
at the 1.4200 level. Next resistance comes in at the 1.4400 level.

The June U.S. dollar index closed 75 points higher at 116.24 today.
Bulls are regaining momentum. The recent double-top reversal on the
daily bar chart still favors the bears longer-term. Next resistance
lies at the 116.50 level. First support is seen at the 114.50 area.
My bias is still that a near-term top is in place in the dollar
index.

June U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 lower today at 101 21/32. Prices
scored a bearish "outside day" down on the daily bar chart today,
whereby the high was higher and the low was lower than the previous
session's trading range, with a lower close. Bulls need to show some
resolve soon, after pushing prices well off the lows scored in late
April. A steep six-week-old downtrend line was penetrated on the
upside last week and negated. Also, a minor double-bottom reversal
has occurred on the daily bar chart. Next resistance is seen at 103
9/32. First support is seen at 101 even.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I enjoyed the lunch and part of your presentation last week (I had an other
engagement to attend to, and hence could not make it to the rest of the
presentation and reception following it).

I appreciate the part-time offer, however, I must admit that I did not find
the terms very favorable. Unlike a person who is permamently located in
Houston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between
Austin
and Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.

I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about
this.
I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager level
so that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and more
importantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time to
Enron away from my thesis.

I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Fellow Diver;

We are watching things very closely to see what PADI can do to help the dive industry get back to business as usual.  I want to thank all of you who have sent me notes letting me know that you are still traveling, and still telling friends to get wet and try this cool sport.

We are currently evaluating incentives to encourage you to bring even more people into scuba diving, and we are asking other stakeholders in the industry to do the same.  Every study we have ever done indicates that word of mouth from friends and family brings more people into diving than anything else. So, stay tuned as we develop innovative ways to recognize and reward you for doing what you love to do anyway: tell people about the thrill and fun of scuba diving.

And, just a reminder. I'm still sending out checks to Fellow Diver Newsletter readers for $10.00 until October 31st .  To get yours, just sign up for any PADI Adventures in Diving, Rescue Diver, or Divemaster course, send me your receipt attached to your special Fellow Diver coupon and I'll send you a check. Download your coupon at http://www.padi.com/promo/dfd/ Just type in padidiver when asked for the password.

If you remember, a couple of months ago, we were trying to get Fellow Diver Newsletter readers to join us on Grand Cayman to dive with some huge country western music stars.  Well, if you didn't make it, you can read all about it in this month's issue of Country Weekly.  Travis Tritt and SheDaisy tell you about their great experiences as PADI Divers during Cayman Country.  You can also see story summaries on the PADI Today Home page at http://www.padi.com

Speaking of travel, as you know, the travel industry has been hit hard by the events of September 11th.  I just wanted to thank all of you who participated in our online survey at http://www.padi.com about your future travel plans.  As of this moment, 68 percent of divers taking the survey are not changing existing travel plans.  Of the 32 percent who are changing their plans, about 90 percent are only changing the dates or the destination of their travel.  That means only 10 percent of divers taking the survey are permanently canceling their trips.  Please do your best to support the airline, hospitality, and resort sectors of the world economy and book a dive trip soon.

According to our information, now that the summer dive season is winding down in the northern hemisphere, literally hundreds of PADI Dive Centers and Resorts are gearing up for PADI Seal Team programs.  Earlier this year, PADI launched this program for kids eight and older.  They get to do AquaMissions like Creature ID, Environment, Navigation, and Snapshot specialist.  Check it out at http://www.padisealteam.com/what.asp  or call your local PADI Dive Center.  If you take your children, nieces or nephews into a PADI Dive Center or Resort and sign them up for the PADI Seal Team program, I'll do my best to get them on the PADI Home Page where more than 10,000 of your fellow divers will see them every day. Just send me a photo or two of them taken during the program, along with the name of the PADI facility. You can send photos and stories to me a brianc@padi.com

Until next month, get a friend (signed up for The PADI Open Water Diver course) and go diving!  They'll thank you for doing it!

Capacity in a Competitive Market
?Conference Call on Friday, June 8th at 11:00 a.m. (EDT)

On May 29th EPSA circulated a draft position on the issues raised during our
earlier meeting on assuring adequate capacity in a competitive market.  We
invited comments on that draft and promised to circulate a revised draft in
advance of conference call scheduled on Friday, June 8th to discuss this
issue further.

Attached are two documents.  One is an extensively red-lined version of the
May 29th draft based on comments forwarded from several members.  Where
possible, we have incorporated suggested changes and identified, with
brackets ([ ]), alternative proposals or issues needing further discussion.
Also attached is an alternative set of bullets drafted by Jeff Roark at
Mirant suggesting an another way to organize the points.  Thank you all for
your time and effort on this project.

Please review both documents in preparation for Friday's call, which will be
held at 11:00 a.m. (EDT).  To access the conference call, dial 1-800-937-6563

I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

BB to BB+  $2,500,000
Below BB  Zero

Will you be able to join other VentureWire subscribers
in the Bay Area for this month's Breakfast Briefing?

We'll be gathering at the San Mateo Marriott on
Wednesday, September 19, to hear Mark Klopp's thoughts
on this month's topic:

When Corporate and Venture Worlds Collide - Aligning
Investment Strategies to Drive Innovation and Generate
Returns

While times are certainly tough across the board, new
opportunities for creating profitable, sustainable
investment strategies continue to emerge. Innovative
companies such as Eastman Chemical have led the charge
in using venturing as a way to spur corporate
transformation and create long-term value. Moreover,
by understanding the often complementary strategies
that drive their respective investment decisions,
corporate and private VCs stand to gain a unique
perspective with which to explore mutually profitable
relationships.

=B7 What is the current state of corporate venturing?
=B7 What are some examples of corporations and VCs
working together to build companies?
=B7 How can you balance strategic vs. financial
value?
=B7 How can you prove value despite sagging returns?
=B7 To what extent does the corporate VC serve as an
"inside/outside pipe" for driving innovation?
=B7 How can corporate VCs and private VCs leverage
distinct skill sets in a spirit of cooperation to
drive innovation and change?

Join us for a provocative discussion of these and
other important questions led by Mark Klopp, managing
director of Eastman Ventures, Eastman Chemical Co.

Register by Thursday, September 13th and you'll pay
only $99 and ensure your name in the attendance
roster. Register online for this VentureWire Breakfast
Briefing at:

I think Paintball looks good.

I think we should just all go to the store together and split the cost
of the alcohol.

Also, maybe play some poker at the house at night.  Maybe everybody can
bring a few dollars for a house game.

No preference on the cake.

Oh, Tommy are you coming to the party???

Luke, please give my address to Bridgett:

EMAILTEXT:
Thanks for the e-mail.  The info I sent yesterday was not complied by me.  I
took over the reporting just yesterday and am making changes to it.  The
information I will provide on the log from London is what I hear in the
morning meeting.  What I need to do is ensure I get complete info from you,
so I will send you the London information each day as I understand it and you
can add comments.

EMAILTEXT:
Hi, Tom.  I'm up here working on the 33rd floor for Louise Kitchen again.  They've asked me if I can stay and help out for the entire day, and Ina said that it's fine with her (coverage-wise).  I'm actually working on Mark Knippa's and Gary Bryan's expense reports, and simply helping with phones and occasionally some minor things for Louise.  Let me know if you need me to do anything, or if you'd just rather me stay down there cuz ya miss me!!

You can also call me at extension 34220 ... that's the number where I'm sitting.
